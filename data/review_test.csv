"Newt Gingrich presents common sense solutions to the pressing issues of our day in a clear concise and easily understood manner.  This book should be required reading for all civics and history classes in high school and college.  If the policies Dr. Gingrich proposes could be implemented, the US would not only become the shining city on a hill, it would also become, far and away, the world's most powerful economy throughout the next fifty years with prosperity for all Americans who chose to join the ownership society he envisions

"When I was in the sixth grade we moved twice, and in all three of the schools from New Jersey to Connecticut to Japan I got to study Ancient Greece in the history part of the class.  I also got a lot of mileage out of having read Edith Hamilton's ""Mythology"" (I still have my mythology report with my versions of all of the illustrations).  But in all the times I got to study Ancient Greece before, during, and after the sixth grade I never got to do any of the fun stuff that Avery Hart & Paul Mantell come up with for ""Ancient Greece!: 40 Hands-On Activities to Experience This Wondrous Age.""  

This Kaleidoscope Kids volume for kids ages 7-12 not only offers activities but also a variety of information about the Ancient Greeks.  So this is not simply a book of activities that teachers can pick and choose from to give their students hands-on experiences, it is also a source of facts and stories that will supplement what exists in whatever textbook is being used.  Throughout the book there are ""Great Greeks!"" and things to ""Think About.""  After reminding young readers of the gifts that have come down to us from Ancient Greece, Hart and Mantell get students acclimated to the idea of looking at the past from the perspective of those who lived way back when.  Then the book looks at key periods of Greek history.

""Meet the Minoans: The Pre-Greeks of Crete"" looks at the culture that gave rise to the greatness of Greece with activities to make a Greek yo-yo, a Great Mother figure, a Hamster Labyrinth (without the Minotaur), and a fantastic fresco.  That gives you an indication of the sort of activities to be found in this book before we even get to Greece itself.  Other chapters are devoted to ""The Age of Heroes,"" where you get a super-short version of ""The Iliad"" and can build a Trojan Horse, ""Language Unites!"" (including speaking ""Pig Greek""), ""The Dawn of a Golden Age,"" where you can organize a pentathlon and make a victory wreath, and ""Ye Gods! Greek Religion and Mythology,"" where you can design your own constellation.

In the last part of the book chapters cover ""Classical Athens: The Flower of Ancient Civilization,"" where you get to build a Greek Temple with Ionic columns (or even build the entire Parthenon), ""Think For Yourself: Philosophy,"" where students can make a monochord or hold a symposium, and ""The Amazing Arts,"" which covers create sculptures and painting pots in the first part and making masks to make up a Greek play in the second part.  The final chapter covers ""A Wider World: Alexander the Great and the Hellenistic Age,"" where you can start a library.  At the end, students can appreciate how being a Greek meant standing in the center of the world (as least, as far as the Ancient Greeks were concerned).  

Again, there are some key issues to be discussed to go along with the activities.  Students can debate what is the difference between a hero and a celebrity, understand why every vote counts in a democracy, and decide what makes somebody beautiful.  Learning how to press olives or how huge blocks of marble were transported across the sea, gives students an appreciation for how things were different way back when.  Throughout the book Hart and Mantell show how ancient ideas live on in modern traditions, which remains the biggest legacy of the Ancient Greeks.  

I teach Classical Greek & Roman Mythology (not to be confused with Modern Greek & Roman Mythology apparently) but I teach it online so I do not really have any opportunities to have my students engage in hands-on activities.  But that does not mean I cannot do them in the privacy of my own home or that elementary school teachers will not find these extremely useful for their unit on Ancient Greece.  Although I am suddenly reminded of coming up with the ""Sparthens"" (a.k.a. the warriors with the brains) in elementary school.  But that is another story

"Renowned artist and tarot scholar/writer Robert M. Place has produced a masterpiece in his new tarot 384 page companion book, The Buddha Tarot Companion: A Mandala of Cards. This book affords a rich unique perspective of the Tarot through the lens of the Buddhist paradigm. The companion deck comes in a beautifully illustrated box containing exquisitely designed cards that fit perfectly in my hand, a tiny black gossamer bag plus a bordered little white box with the instructions, ""Embellish this box with protective and/or empowering symbols."" Other suggestions that greet you as you begin your journey with the Buddha cards include: ""Smudge with sage to cleanse and re-energize the cards after a reading."" and ""Store your deck with stones or crystals that absorb negative energy, promote healing, or provide protective energy."" Also included in the box is a mini-book with guidelines on reading these particular cards. Both items are published by Llewellyn, who as always, have taken great care to ensure quality and aesthetics in the way the cards are packaged and presented.

Robert has done an amazing job in correlating the life of the Buddha with the Tarot journey through the cards. He describes how the Major Arcana fits perfectly with the life of Siddhartha and his journey of enlightenment. Each of the tarot trumps is a stage on the mystic's journey to enlightenment. In fact, it is Mr. Place's belief that the creators of the Tarot were directly influenced by the life of the Buddha, and incorporated archetypes into the Major Arcana based on his journey. He teaches that the ancient wisdoms were not isolated from one another. Instead, ""the classical world maintained communications with India and the ancient Western philosophers were familar with Indian philosophies."" As well, the Islamic world introduced the Christians to the life of the Buddha during the Middle Ages. ""The European Christians were enamored with the story, and they transformed him into a Christian saint - St. Josaphat."" 

I was fascinated by the titles given to the Major Arcana cards. Each of the 23 cards reflect an important aspect of the Siddhartha's personal journey to become the enlightened one, the Buddha.

Robert Place has created a deck and book that not only meets the needs of people who practice Eastern beliefs. He also acts as a mediator to help people of the Western world learn about and appreciate the noble tenets of Buddhism and its teachings for life. I highly recommend this deck - I found it very easy to follow, the graphics are amazingly detailed and artistically rendered and the companion book clearly helps you to learn to ""read"" using a Buddhist world view.

"Jmaes Joyce takes us on Stephen Daedalus' interior journey from pre-teen as son of a country gentleman to young adult who wanders the streets of Dublin, struggling with sin, salvation, intellect, ambivalence about his homeland, and his father's decline.  It is not a linear path, but then whose is?  The story is not so much about the artist as a young man, but about a young man's journey to artistic sensibility, its pretensions and exhilirations.

"The theory behind this important collection of essays is that &quot;the history of medieval power is to be sought in microcosms.&quot; These essays demonstrate quite effectively that it can be found there as well.  Each  essay focuses on a facet of the shifting power relationships in twelfth and  thirteenth century Europe.  At issue in each are the questions of what or  who held the power to command or punish, and how that power was obtained,  kept and manifested.  This is a truly enlightening book. Of particular  interest are the essays on holding power over the truth, as well as those  dealing the formation of the nobility into a self-consciously chivalric  warrior class.  However, all the essays are intelligent and useful  explorations into the very nature and meaning of power.  Ultimately, this  book must be considered essential for any serious student of history,  casual or academic

"I was referred to this book by my midwife (Debra O'Conner) as a book that I had to read as it's content was so &quot;right on&quot; and was she ever right.  I know alot about my body.  I am a licensed massage therapist and a mother of a 3 year old that I had at home.  I spent hours and hours learning about my body during the childbirth process.  That was great knowledge to add to the physiology I learned during my massage training.  This book though, is something that every woman in our culture today should read. I now understand so much about my life and the directions it has taken!  I hope to give this to everyone I know who has a daughter.  I hope they will read it for themselves and then pass in on to their daughters when they feel the time is right.  Our culture today is so lacking in this kind of positive message.  It is women's reality and needs to be shared.  Of course it is written by a Midwife!  Thank you Elizabeth

"Malphurs does an excellent job of laying out the strategic planning process step by step and in great detail.  I really appreciated the fact that he takes into account things like church patriarchs/matriarchs and other church dynamics that are often not addressed practically in ministry books.  He almost makes the process seem easy, and maybe it is, IF you are starting a new church or are in the very early stages of a church plant.  However, much of the material seems practically impossible to implement in a ""plateau'ed"" or ""downward spiraling"" church that has been around for 100 years.  The principles are easy and make sense IF you have 100% support of the congregation.  That's pretty hard to do in most of the churches I've been in that need strategic planning the most.   That's no fault of Malphurs; the book itself is a great book

"Carl Hiaasen spins a tale of adventure and humor that should motivate young readers to protect wildlife and natural resources. Hoot is set in the seaside town of Coconut Cove. The plot revolves around Mother Paula's Pancake House, a fictitious restaurant chain in Florida about to build its 100th store on a parcel of land inhabited by families of burrowing owls. The developers know about the endangered owls and removed legal evidence of the owls from public records. Unwary citizens applaud Mother Paula's in Coconut Cove. 

The lone crusader for the owls is a boy nicknamed Mullet Fingers who lives in the backwoods dodging truant officers. He pulls up construction stakes and invents other nocturnal forays to stop development. Mullet Fingers enlists the help of his step sister, Beatrice and new kid, Roy. Beatrice is a middle-school soccer queen who holds her own with the boys. Roy is a level-headed kid who moves to Coconut Cove from Montana, earning the dubious title of Cowgirl. 

When you throw in a zany cop, a redneck construction boss, a sly businessman, a high school teacher willing to support kids acting for righteous causes and a bully whose attempts to squash Roy you've got a pretty good read!

"""The Climb"" was written by Bourkeev and DeWalt as an answer to Krakaur's ""Into Thin Air"". While not showcasing the same prose as Krakaur's book, I feel that this is utlamitely better. My reasoning for this opinion is that ""The Climb"" seems like a much more fair and unbiased account. Bourkeev does not resort to playing the blame game; he simply tells the story as he experienced it. Krakaur, it seemed to me at least, relied to heavily on assumptions, and we all now what happens when you assume (hint: you make an _____ out of you and me) and came off as very arrogant and (for some reason) took a feverious dislike to Bourkeev and Lopsang. Thought not as well written as ""Into Thin Air"", ""The Climb"" still managed to draw me in fully, although some parts of the book are a little confusing, mainly the interview with Bourkeev about his single handed rescue of three striken climbers who otherwise would have surely perieshed. This interview was conducted in English, the only problem with that is that Bourkeev's English is not very strong! It is passable and most of the time you can understand him but in other parts it is very hard to dechyper. DeWalt tries to help by adding ""translations"" about what Bourkeev is saying but I felt the interview should have been caried out in Bourkeev's native tongue of Russian and then translated into English. To not have done this is a great injustice to Bourkeev. If you want to read a fair and unbiased book about the May 1996 Everest tragidy that was written simply to tell the truth and not to play smeer tatics and make money (as Krakaur's clearly was), read this. I really recommend you read both books, though and also check out the IMAX movie ""Everest"".

"I read The Hundred Penny Box when I was in third grade 13 years ago.  Its messages of love and memory have stayed with me and will continue to do so forever.  I have created my own Hundred Penny Box and just made one for a friend's newborn son.

We read it together and discussed his own memories over the years.

It delves into the lives of those in poverty without straying far from the lavish lifestyles of English royalty and wealth.

There were a few very alluring relationships between the narrator and the men she encounters creating a whirlwind of emotions for the reader but in the end, I was very pleased with the romantic outcome of the book.  So if you are deciding whether or not you'd like to read this after having read The Other Boleyn Girl, I greatly encourage you to do so, you won't regret it

"""Doctor Livingstone I presume?"" is undoubtedly one of the most well known quotes in history.  Very few people, however, are familiar with the history underlying the meeting of Dr. David Livingstone and Henry Morton Stanley.

This book details the lives of the two men and the historical background through which they were thrown together.  Livingstone, one of the foremost explorers of his day is searching for the source of the Nile River.  Through a combination of bad luck, poor planning, disease, weather, natives, etc., Livingstone is virtually stranded on the banks of Lake Tangyanika.

Henry Stanley, a newspaper correspondent undertakes a rescue mission at the direction of his publicity hungry publisher.  This book details that mission and the international setting under which it took place.  The perils of African exploration in the late 19th century cannot be overstated.  This book does an excellent job impressing this upon the reader.  

I found this book very similar in style and experience to Undaunted Courage (which detailed the Voyage of Discovery undertaken by Lewis and Clark) and River of Doubt (dealing with Theodore Roosevelt's exploration of the Amazon basin.  If you enjoyed either of these books, you will like this one as well.  If you read this book and enjoy it, I highly recommend the other two

"First off, I loved the book cover- spine and all-- one of my all time favorites. It's what first attracted me to this book amongst the other forward-facing covers on the store's front table. Then the title, I loved that just as much. Both share the characteristics of being straightforward, to the point, and revealing. Both are perfectly simple. I read most the essays and came to think that a. this guy really does his homework and b. he has a vocabulary more voluminous than the decimal numbers of pi. I constantly begged for my dictionary. It's probably what gets him the press I knew before I picked this up: an intellectual snob. I guess he got that from the Oprah incident. But I also guess that there's lots of worse name calling that can happen to anyone in their career. What's up with this culture that it's so unacceptably horrible to be labeled an intellectual snob and so enviously warming to be called a pop culture icon? The attraction to Franzen's work is that he investigates and reveals- in a binary way: He's researching facts, he's listening to feelings; he's processing both to give an opinion. The best example of this is My Father's Brain in which he relates the Alzheimer induced decomposing of his father's brain. There is lots about the history and science of memory in this essay; as much as there is about how a family discovers and lives with its loss. Reading it you sympathize, you empathize and you learn. Equally as insightful are :
Lost in the Mail- a look into possible reasons behind Chicago's underperforming mail system
The Reader in Exile- a great reflection on the intellectual and emotional fruits of reading
First City- a historical and pensive piece about what pulls us towards cities
Meet Me in St. Louis- a piece that shares the two-sided feelings in a trio of situations (including the Oprah incident).

Frazee's comical ""Guide for Babies of All Ages"" has a subconscious message behind the humor, meanwhile encouraging those first few steps that will open up a universe of new experiences, baby leaving the shelter of the familiar for the unknown. The roly-poly baby illustrated is tiny compared to everything around him, objects taller than him, but once he pulls himself up and begins that first, tentative journey, it is impossible to stop. Of course, there are a few cautions along the way, ""be careful of things that are wobbly; stay away from fragile stuff"". There are the usual setbacks, too-much too-soon and a tumble to the floor, followed by a howl and the effort to being again. Cleverly worded and cheerfully illustrated, this tongue-in-cheek guide is a delight, offering more food for thought than is first apparent. Luan Gaines/ 2006.

"We have now entered a second time of deep concern for the science, math, and technological education for everyone. The first one occurred after the Sputnik fiasco, when the Russians beat us in the race to reach space. The  concern now has risen due to what science groups such as the American  Association for the Advancement of Science, and educators saw in comparison  of assessments made of students in the U.S. and those in other developed  countries, such as Japan. The answer to this concern was for the AAAS along  with other groups to put out a guideline as to what constitutes scientific  literacy, and what the public in the U.S. should at least know to be  scientifically literate. As usual, though the AAAS addressed the fact that  certain groups in the U.S. were not being 'included' in the pursuit of  science literacy, such as women and racial minorities, in this their first  book they skipped over those of us with disabilities. Since this is a major  concern of mine and the area in which I do research, I was appalled to see  they neglected 'us' once again, especially as the AAAS has a separate  department dealing with the Disabled/Deaf.  In spite of this mistake, the  writing of this book has laid the groundwork for universities and colleges  as to what the teachers they train should know and be able to teach so that  our country can be more scientifically literate. With new information being  made available through newspapers and the Internet on a daily basis, it is  absolutely imperative that all adults regardless of race, gender, or  ability be able to glean the information they need from this outpouring of  information to make decisions requiring informed consent in health care,  decisions on employment (since health care is one of the top employers in  the U.S. today), and to teach their children. This book was the beginning,  but it isn't the end. More books have further elucidated what is required  for science literacy from both the AAAS and other science groups. This is  the place to start if you are an educator of any kind who wants their  students to become scientifically literate. Karen Sadler, Science  Education, University of Pittsburgh, klsst23@pitt.ed

  If you are curious about the Cambridge Patonists, Patrides carefully edited selection of texts gives you the cream of the crop! - Benjamin Whichcote, Ralph Cudworth, John Smith, Henry More et al. - material reprinted from the original texts, complete with all the archaic but fascinating English spellings. The texts are fully annotated with comparisons and 
references to a wide range of cognate works. 

 If you are reading the Cambridge Platonists as part of an academic exercise or are otherwise familiar with their milieu, well and good. You will know what to expect. I think it is worth saying something here - for the general reader. I am sufficiently 'unmodern' (or perhaps 'un-postmodernist') to
read the Cambridge Platonists because I think they still have something valuable to say! 

 Not everyone would agree with me - but, I think the portrait of Benjamin Whichcote which graces the cover of this book (and the frontispiece) says something about the sort of men we are dealing with. (The portrait still hangs in the gallery at Emmanuel College, Cambridge). There is composure in that expression. It seems to infuse the whole being of the man. It is the expression of a mind which has found calm waters,
seen eternal verities. 

  One of the papers in this book - Ralph Cudworth's, was preached as a Sermon Before the House of Commons (i.e. the British Parliament). Things are different with us today. We are no longer certain of eternal verities. It seems almost incomprehensible - now, to think that when the Cambridge Platonists were expounding their ideas in the 17th c., they were touching on matters of concern to most thinking people.
Religion and science had not yet parted company (despite being called a 'father of modern science' in school books, Issac Newton was a deeply religious man, very much in tune with the ideas of the Cambridge Platonists).   

 The great beauty of the Cambridge Platonists, is their calm confidence, their utter conviction that there are eternal verities, that Reason and Faith are complementary faculties. Thus, on the one hand, they looked back to the philosophers of antiquity (strictly speaking, they are Neo-Platonists, taking in everything between Plato, Plotinus, Ficino/Renaissance thought, even Hermeticism) - and the legacy of Christianity, while on the other hand - they were alive to the emerging 'scientific' spirit, the renewed quest to understand the principles ordering the phenomenal universe. For them, there was an Intelligent - and intelligible order in the universe. For them, Reason (capital R) still had its pre-Kantian, classical sweep. 'Reason' was not a mere idea in the head, an itching in the cranium, but presupposed the divine Nous (intellect), intimately connected with the activity of a divine energy (energeia)informing the pattern of the universe. We find them preaching against false religious 'enthusiasm' - as soundly as they preached against atheism. 

     ""Good men spiritualise their bodies; bad men do 
      incarnate their souls. "" 

     ""We are no more than Second causes; and our
      Suffiency is only in God, who is the First.
      A Second Cause is no Cause, divided from 
      the First. ""

This story strangely begins when the earth is destroyed by a Vogon construction fleet clearing the way for a hyper space express way. The last Earthman, Arthur Dent, is saved by his best friend Ford Prefect, who is actually an alien that comed from a small palnet somewhere in the vecinity of Betelgeuse.

Inside they meet up with Zaphod Beeblebrox, the two headed, three armed president of the galaxy, Trillian, an Earthwoman who Arthur failed to pick up and wnt with Zaphod, and Marvin, a parinoid android. This book tells of there amazing adventures throughought the galaxy. These adventures involve mice, an abandonded planet, a rather suprised sperm whale, and the number 42.

If you're looking for light reading with a historical basis, this is definitely NOT what you're looking for

"This book focuses on a cogent question by way of a true story and invites response from all sorts of people with pertinent experience, providing biographies of these respondents. The topic is forgiveness. I found the analysis by Dennis Prager, an L.A. talk show host, the most understanding of Christian/Jewish outlooks and Jose Hobday's perhaps the best of the Christian contributions. I am eager to discuss it with members of my theology group.

"This text was assigned reading in a Psych101 back in 1970, but its themes have stayed with me so strongly I am now ordering it for my personal library.  I was born with a club foot, and experienced the power of being  different, even though my personal defect was so minor as to be rarely  noticed by others.  STIGMA gave me an appreciation of the force behind my  own shame and the reaction to my difference of others.  More importantly, I  learned about the degrees of identity-- which differences make the most  difference (sex, race, disabilities...) and the increasing intensity that  comes with breaking the most closely held norms.

"Beginning with the introduction, I was taken on a fabulous journey. These gifted authors write a wonderful narrative.  Lande's Snapshots add a lot to this impressive and comprehensive companion. They are as engaging as any short story in the New Yorker!
I found the collection of old posters designer appealing integrated with beautiful photography, as one would expect from National Geographic. 
The Guide is uniquely for both armchair and active travelers and TWO books in one. The first carefully expertly evaluates Top Ten lists on everything travel related, from Hotels to Hideaways, National Parks to International Markets.  Subjective of course. We all have our favorites.  I particularly liked a chapter called ""Ten Best Things to do on Sunday Afternoons in Ten Cities"".
PART TWO includes Literary and Historical journeys, elevating this travel guide above all others.  Ready made and travel ready. I'm on my way on the Road to Mandalay! 
The book ends at lands end, with a country-by-country supplement to best destinations. What a travel kit!  National Geographic's Ten Best of Everything is passport perfect in every way. You'll love every moment.

"Kurzweil opens with a very heartfelt recounting of his return to Judaism and his personal path which led him to Rabbi Steinsaltz. From there the chapters fly by effortlessly, partitioned in small chapters of which each is it's own midrash, giving each of us something to reflect upon and discuss. This is for everyone who wants to know more about not only Steinsaltz, but the beauty and wisdom of the Jewish faith

"An amazing resource to the odd world of Chick collecting.  Mr. Fowler has crafted an exhausting, almost overwhelming guide to all of Chick's works and articles about him.  Everything is cross-referenced to the point of where the reader is nearly overwhelmed with information.  Minute details of publishing histories and changes to individual tracts are documented down to the smallest letter.  The book (presented in a distinctive computer printout style, possibly due to its origins as a self-published work) is packed with charts of pricing info and catalog numbers.  But even casual Chick fans will enjoy the &quot;History of the World&quot; segment, which ties all of Jack's wild theories into a cohesive narrative, and a segment devoted entirely to fun trivia (there's a list of every instance of the term &quot;haw&quot; for instance).  Each tract and comic is described, and info is given on various parodies and rip-offs.  This is a must for all Chick fans (both &quot;saved&quot; and otherwise)

"The book is not 'really' on Christ in the Etheric, but more several - ""unrelated"" - lectures about Etheric Life. Sometimes Christ only gets mentioned at the very end of a lecture.

The book can be summed up as an accumalation of lectures of ""cosmic life"" if you like: the spiritual life that is connected with, and influences, life as seen only from/with physical senses. 

In the book is recorded about several ""ages"" (Golden Age, Silver Age, Iron Age and Dark Age), and that how in each age clairvoyant abilities - [or really spiritual consciousness] - diminished with each age, and that the Dark Age has ended in 1899AC and that in this current Age people need to become spiritually aware again to the point where they have a ""Damascus experience"" (experience of Saul - later Paul - in which he saw Christ in Etheric form).
People who do not become spiritually aware will be bound into the Earth consciousness/sphere and could cause disturbances in the Earth.

In this light, Rudolf Steiner communicated about the brotherhoods - in Western and Eastern countries - and how they try to prevent people from developing spiritually to the point where they will be able to meet Christ in the Etheric (= 2nd coming of Christ (coming in the Etheric)... and in future times coming of Christ (i.e. manifestation/presence of Christ in the astral)).

In the book is also recorded about the Sermon on the Mount - with the Beautitudes (recorded in Matthew 5) where Jesus communicated about the development of the soul (as recorded in other books by Rudolf Steiner (sentient soul, intellectual soul, etc.)). 

In the book is also recorded about ""the afterlife"" if you like: life of souls who have passed away and are still Earthbound, and how those souls are connected to those souls that are incarnated in a physical body in Earth.

In the book is communicated about different levels in the 'afterlife' and how feelings and will are active. It is recorded about astral plane, lower devachan and higher devachan in ""Etherization of the Blood"" and later on again in ""Three Realms between Death and Rebirth"" where is recorded in greater detail how activity in those realms is connected with life of souls incarnated in the Earth and how Christ is also present there and can be experienced in Earthly life as 'destiny'... and how people are so focused on what is, or has happened, but don't pay attention to what is result of it not happening (e.g. getting delayed for an appointment, or coming ('unexpectedly') too early etc.). Destiny is at work, with Christ having its workings present in it according to Rudolf Steiner.

In the book is also located about ""the double"" and how forces from within the Earth influence it [geo-biology]. Ireland was a place where those influences where most 'healthy' for spiritual development/cognition and Ireland was the place where Christianity was able to flourish and waver out from to Europe by Irish monks

"I just got through reading ""Harvey Penick's Little Red Book"".  I enjoyed it so much that I had to apologize about my delay in submitting a positive comment on the seller's feedback page. But the book was that enjoyable! I read the book because I was told it is a good example in marketing and business management ideals.  I don't even play golf! I was able to apply Harvey Penick's words to attitudes and approaches to life though!  He not only teaches what he has learned about golf during his long rich life, but he also teaches a philosophy in how to live one's life.  His methods of evaluating the actions of his students and sharing what he has learned in an effort to improve thier lives is obvious to me.  He refuses to use negative impressions in his teachings.  Instead, he accentuates the positive.  He educates by guiding his students instead of ""teaching"" them.  I love his ability to teach with images, parables and metaphors.  His chapter ""First Things First"" about the golfer who wanted to get out of sand traps is great!  After all, the problem is not always what you think.  I challenge anyone to read ""Harvey Penick's Little Red Book"" and share with me how they can apply his knowledge to thier business and personal lives.  Whether you play golf or not, this book is good reading

"Generally, my eyes glaze over as I reach chapter 3 of most business books as they provide the mastery of the intuitively obvious. Make Your Own Luck by Shapiro and Stevenson has broken the pattern. Written in punchy conversational style, the book is a delightful combination of anecdotes and useful tools geared to help the reader up the odds in personal and business decision-making. The process of setting goals and assessing risk is broken down into discrete aspects, allowing the reader to assess his own patterns of success and failure. This sounds as if it could be tedious, but it's not. The authors know you are not sitting in a policy course. They know that you make numerous bets in any given day and do it most of the time without focusing on the decision as a bet. The book makes you conscious of those bets and gives you the groundwork to move through those bets with speed and focus. In managing investments, I'm betting on a gestalt of macro economic factors and company specific performance as well as betting on the actions of other investors. The tools in Make Your Own Luck, such as the Prediction Map, are completely applicable to the inferential analysis I use in managing investments as well as life's major problems, such as how to seat guests at the next dinner party. This book is a good read. Shapiro and Stevenson incorporate topics from baseball to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Make Your Own Luck makes you laugh, makes your think and gives you tools to improve your own lot.

"Yes, Ben Witherington is a (relative) conservative, but don't hold that against him. Yes, he has strong opinions, but don't hold that against him, either, because they are well argued. The fact remains that this is the best overview of &quot;Third Quest&quot; Jesus scholarship I have been able to find. Admirers of the Jesus Seminar may not appreciate his critique, but it is very fair and well-thought out. One of the benefits from a book like this, besides giving interested parties a launching pad for further research, is that the different views of Jesus can help one achieve a well-rounded portrait of the Savior. No one scholar gets it right all the time (not even Witherington, with his own view of Jesus as God's wisdom), but the different insights are valuable, because Jesus is bigger than what any one person can comprehend. That should be a cause for humility (something some Jesus scholars have lacked, at least in print). I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in contemporary Jesus scholarship

"Billy Collins's original voice is delightfully accessible, often blending comedy and solemnity in one poem, and always with something new to say. The playful tone of these poems can be misleading; whether he is writing about eating a good plate of Osso Bucco or his favorite museum rooms, there is  always a pathos lingering in the silence after the last line. Most  relieving is the absence of pretentiousness or haughty language. This is  simply, as Robert Bly writes in his introduction to the best American poems  of 1999, Collins's skillful ability to &quot;bring the soul up close to the  thing&quot; in every poem. Books such as &quot;The Art of Drowning&quot;  threaten to change the face and purpose of poetry in the 21st century.  Let's hope there is plenty more to come from Billy Collins

"Noah Webster's book is fascinating reading for today's students and teachers alike, as well as for the average citizen, as there is much to learn from it.  While it may be inappropriate to resurrect it as an  official school text, it certainly has a place in every school library.   One of the most notable features is the comprehensive phonetic system used,  with diacritical marks (accents) applied to all relevant vowels and  consonants; words are divided according to syllables and stress.  It also  spells the names of letters of the alphabet; something which tends to be  ignored in modern teaching.  The terminology of traditional grammar is  used, and there are copious word lists, with words grouped according to  common factors. I have no hesitation in recommending this book to all  students of the English language for the above reasons and for many other  interesting aspects (now-archaisms:thy/thou...; foreign words and phrases;  abbreviations explained; punctuation; etc).  This book should remain a  spelling classic

"The best book on the history of World War II that I've read in a long time. 

The title has three meanings: 

1. It can refer to the gunner at the back of a bomber. The Brits called these people 'Rear Gunners.' The Yanks used the term 'Tail Gunner.' It's the most dangerous position in the plane. 

2. The last plane in the formation. This was more true in the American Combat Box than in British usage. This position is difficult to hold because it is at the end of a string and every move by the lead ship propagates irregularily through the formation. It is also more dangerous as enemy fighters can attack this ship more easily since there aren't so many guns pointing that direction. 

3. It can refer to the bombing missions near the end of the war. 

This splendid book covers all three of these meanings. In addition it does an excellent job of discussing the power and importance of air power in the defeat of Germany

"Published in 1986, Dr. Deming ""Out of the Crisis"" seems to form the basis for the transformation needed in American management mentality. Two main subjects are discussed in the book. The first is the exposure of problems and pitfalls in top management operations, the second, relates suggestions and solutions that can solve and transform the way American management operates. 14 core points are suggested by Dr. Deming to address problems in management and are supported by many examples using different scientific methods. 
Throughout the book, Dr. Deming promotes the loss of slogans that are even today being practiced by a share of the American Industry, and advocates management that is based on principles such as quality and leadership. At times, the book is not a continuous process that is easy to follow, but overall, Dr. Deming's concepts are transferred to the reader.

"This book starts with the fundamentals of atomic structure and then builds on them until molecular orbital theory.  Molecular orbital theory is developed for both organic and inorganic substances.  Molecular orbital theory is used to explain the electronic structure of molecules, which is, of course, of fundamental importance to the chemist.

Bonding theories for organic and inorganic models are developed and a brief treatment is given on the solid state at the end of the book.

This is a book that I often use as a reference.  This book is versatile enough to refresh the chemist about bonding ideas in both organic and inorganic areas.  It is not a particularly advanced book, but it was a pleasure for me to read and a good book to remind me of the basics when I need it

"Generations of hate come together in this book.  Pete Braga killed Franklin McMichael dead in a claim of self-defense in the summer of 1952.  The next generation carried on the tradition when Gabriel McMichael supposedly beat Pete's son, Victor, so severely that he suffered permanent brain damage, rendering him with the IQ of a ten-year old.  The third generation was naïve to all this hatred when Thomas McMichael fell in love with Pete's granddaughter Patricia.  The love of his life was driven away at a young age when Grandfather Pete refused to permit their love to blossom.  While the McMichael family existed in near poverety, the Braga family thrived in power and money.

So now Thomas has a problem.  The root of all his family's hatred, Pete Braga, has been found dead.  He was murdered by someone at his home.  Thomas has been assigned the case to find out who wanted the old man dead.  Given his many enemies, the list of suspects is long.  It doesn't help that the first suspect, Sally Rainwater...Pete's personal nurse, becomes the object of Thomas' heart as the investigation unravels. 

The story twists and turns through many leads and many unexpected plot points as Thomas McMichael is determined, despite his family's hatred of Pete, to find out who is behind the killing and why.  Author T. Jefferson Parker does an excellent job in keeping the reader involved and interested in the story with his enthralling style.

"The story is both true and extremely unique: The Author, who is an Austrian mountaineer and a SS Nazi officer at the same time,  escapes from a British POW camp in India with the goal to go through Tibet to Japan-occupied Burma, to be sent back to Germany, so as not to miss his chance to participate in WWII.  The extreme difficulties of hiding from officials and surviving the wintry elements of the Himalaya mountains make his Burma plan impossible, so he stays in Tibet.  His unthinkable achievements include storming his way into the ""Forbidden City"" (Lhassa, the capital), gaining employment in the Tibetian Government, becoming a friend of the ""God-King"" Dalai Lama - an extremely bright, knowledge-hungry teenager, and learning the Tibetian language to the degree which anable him to do live interpretation for Dalai Lana of English-language movies (""Believe me, it is not easy for a German to translate Shakespearian English into Tibetian""). 
Going with a yak through the snows of the 20,000-feet Himalayan passes, escaping merciless robbers, manouvering between border guards - make Seven Years in Tibet a great adventure book. However, the insightful and rich observations about Tibetian people, customs, culture and politics, go far beyond  any other available information on that far-away country, and Dalai-Lama's foreword to this book confirms this fact.
The peaceful and friendly life and culture of Tibet is raped by military annexation of Tibet by China in 1951. The ancient monasteries are destroyed, the Puritan-like culture is replaced by such crude elements of civilization as e.g. brothels for the occupying soldiers,  Dalai Lama twice escapes to India, and so does the Author; one third of the Tibetians die of starvation.
""Seven Tears ib Tibet"" allows us a bitter-seet inside into see a country, that lived the way how countries in medieval times lived; also, the country trampled and largely destroyed by its aggressive neighbour.

Yes, it is European ethnocentric and there are the references to god, but our family was and remains enlightened enough and able to explain *context* even to children.

The lyrical descriptions of wildlife and the orange groves and wild landscape are very appealing.  Your mouth waters as you read her essays on downhome foods like hush puppies.  She turned those into a cookbook which I'll have to try out.
Modern readers squirm uncomfortably at her use of the N----- word and her characterization of blacks as irresponsible, drunken, immoral, etc.  It is probably a faithful representation of common thinking at the time it was written, so recognize it as a snapshot of the times.  Then move past that to luxuriate in the beautiful passages in the book.  (I deducted 1 star for this)

Perhaps the most disheartening, but nonetheless informative section, deals with the counterintuitive measures that social scientists have come up with to measure the impact of literacy. They seem to be lacking in common sense. Goody, however, is full of common sense, and this book is excellent reading

"There are two different types of Larkin poem. The first type, mostly written before 1955, are influenced by Yeats and Auden and are mediocre. The second, written when he found his voice, are amongst the most wonderful works of English literature ever written.
So what was his voice? Basically that of twentieth century man - atheistic, obsessed with sex, regretting the loss of faith and the old certainties. He takes these subjects and turns them into glorious poems. But here's the really incredible thing: he uses ordinary, uncomplicated language. No tricks, no arcane allusions, just plain English.
It can't be denied that the voice is bleak, and it is too uncompromising for some. However, those who like looking into the heart of darkness will find poems which they will remember for the rest of their lives.

"For a recently college graduate and moderate sports world observer with little experience negotiating in a business environment, this book was a pleasure to read. The concepts in this book are on or above par with my textbook on negotiation. However, I specifically enjoyed how Steinberg illustrates important concepts with stories involving the ever interesting personalities of professional sports. From establishing values to finalizing the contract, this book is efficiently organized to lead through the negotiation process. Also, at the end of each sub-chapter is a summary of the key points of the reading. Winning with integrity isn't easy in general, let alone in the ruthless world of sports agents.

"Along with ""From Science To God"" Mr Russell establishes himself as one of the masters of spiritual reawakening.  Although this piece has more doomsday in it than his later work, it has the same hopeful message and the same readability.  

In both books Mr Russell never seems to lose the reader in scientific mumbo jumbo, even when discussing very complicated subjects.  That isn't a statement on his intelligence or research, but rather on his ability to communicate on all levels.  Neither does he offend when he deals with the spiritual aspects of his writings. In short everyone can sit around his table (well, almost everyone).

"This book provides a good and clear overview of the subject of MySQL. This is a thick book that covers a lot of material. The last Chapters even provided introductions to application development with C, PERL and PHP. MySQL: The complete Reference really seemed like an actual complete reference. While it may not go to deep into every subject it does at least briefly cover each topic. Most of the focus was on SQL (Structured Query Language) though.

There were only a few minor issues with this book aside from minor grammatical errors. For one thing, you would occasionally have to modify the sample tables before you could even start the exercise. Also, it would have been nice having more sample tables and data so I could follow along in more of the examples. Frequently, my result set wouldn't quite match the one in the book. Additionally, some of the command wouldn't even execute or would return an error message. Lastly, the chapters on development were pretty useless unless you are already familiar with one of the languages.

But, I believe many of the above problems where because of version differences and the fact that I was running MySQL on windows. Although windows instructions were given as well the book examples were still more oriented towards a UNIX installation. Also, MySQL would be several versions newer on my computer. I believe that made a difference on some of the results as well. And for windows administration its better just to use one of the suggested GUI programs since many of the commands were difficult to run from the command prompt.

So, I wasn't quite able to follow along with all the examples for one reason or another. Nevertheless, there were still plenty of quality examples I could follow along in. In addition, there was still a lot to learn from just reading through the material. Overall, this book works well as a reference or for working the Chapters in order. Even though the book's user level isn't indicated I believe it provides a fine introduction for a beginner.

"Let's Learn Kanji is systematic, it gives you a wealth of basic kanji knowledge (including stroke order and radicals) as well as providing space to practice AND regular worksheets/mini tests so you can monitor your progress! Often kanji books offer only examples and written explanations, or focus soley on repeated written practice. The addition of the mini tests for consolidating your learning makes this book a must have. I studied some kanji previously but found my self directed study slow. While I agree with the other reviewer that the pace seem stedious at first, I after a month I can claim some serious progress! My only concern with this text is that from time to time the mini tests do not have an answer key. All in all an excellent book for self study by motivated beginners

"The book is well-written.  Most parts of it I can agree with.  But there is a crucial mistake in Parson's message --- oneness likes to play separation.   I can say clearly that oneness does not play separation.  Duality/ego is simply a mistake/illusion caused by mind-evolution.  Saying that oneness plays separation is giving reality to this illusion.  Also, his message that we can not do anything still gives one a feeling that one is under the ""mercy"" of something, and this is clearly very dualistic.  Without ego, both doing and not doing are actions of oneness, to intentionally emphasizing not doing is a mistake.  There are many illuminating sentenses in this book, but be aware of the neo-advaitan trap.  In my life, it was understanding, especially of the process of ego-illusion-image helped me to come to oneness.  The one who is doing the understanding is still oneness.  There is no duality in doing and not doing.  At right this moment, you can chose to continue to read this review or to stop.  Of courses, you make choices in daily life.  If you really understand what is meant by ""nond-duality"", you will not make such statements such as ""there is no choice"".

"As a follower of the Celebration story for many years, I was greatly disappointed by what I thought would be a new and interesting perspective on the model town.  It was nothing of the sort.  The book had the feel of  so many pages of anti-Disney propaganda, and the repetitiveness of a bad  serial.  The authors of Celebration U.S.A. clearly made up their minds  about Celebration long before signing off on a mortgage.  Lacking in the  detail needed to illustrate Celebration's experiment with the tenets of  neotraditional style, the book offered splashes of cliched generalities  such as ""a return to the past"" and ""recapturing tradition.""  It soon became  some sort of mantra exhorting Disney's ownership of the town, the rules  imposed on property improvements and maintenance, and, interestingly, the  attention the town received.  Most tactless of all was the shadow of  mockery cast on every description of residents, conversation with  neighbors, and interaction with people doing what the authors SHOULD have  been doing: giving the town a chance

Since it covers the gamut from plastics to jet engines to microprocessors, and it's only 200  pages in a fairly large typeface, I wasn't expecting historical depth.  But  I was expecting at least one fresh idea.  I bought it on the strength of a  much earlier book by Nathan Rosenberg (about technology in the economy of  the 19th century).  I was disappointed.

"Sometimes a reader knows more about a narrow subject than the author. When the author is in error about that subject, the reader may question the accuracy of the descriptions in the rest of the book. Such is the case here.

I've written 123 books; several on parachutes and skydiving. I am a pilot, skydiver and parachute rigger; I know the sport and the industry. 

The author wrote:

""We use flat chutes as parasails."" 
What is ""flat""? Square? Rectangular? Ram-air?
A ""parasail"" is a kite and is usually under tow behind a boat. This sentence does not make any sense.

""Four miles up, he pulled"". That would be 21,120 feet. 
The use of oxygen is not mentioned.

""Ferocious, out of control spiral. One of the cells collapsed."" 
The collapse of a single cell will not cause a fast turn and the cell is easily re-inflated.

""Corkscrewing caused the other cells to collapse."" 
Not likely.

""Guide lines""
An uncommon reference. They are referred to as control lines or toggles. 

He jettisoned the main canopy at 15,000 feet. He freefell ten seconds and opened his reserve at 12,700 feet. The rest of the team on this HAHO jump would still be at 18,000 feet. 
""Five minutes later."" He would be at about 8,000 feet.
""He estimated he had about 15 minutes of glide remaining.""
More like eight minutes.

 ""He was so relaxed, he was startled to hear canopies fluttering all around him and the sound of men splashing down just under him.""
How did they all beat him to the landing area? They were 5,000 feet above him. 

Fiction writers have a responsibility to make their descriptions accurate.
When a reader finds obvious discrepancies in one area, it makes him or her wonder if the rest of the book is accurate.

And, the writing is not creative.

Puzo (like Leon Uris) definitely lost the touch near the end of his career and this book is no exception.  In just a few hundred pages, President Kennedy II is shown as a tyrant, a socialist, a reactionary, a humanitarian, a political bumbler, a visionary of USA utopia, a man who would kill a few thousand citizens to save himself from impeachment, a liar who can beat the ultimate lie detector, a dear and loving husband/father, etc....how many characters must one man be?

"I can see how instructors would be enthusiastic about this book, but unfortunately it will in no way help the student develop their ear training. Here's the problem. The book and CD basically outlines a METHOD of ear training, it is not ear training itself. For example, for each step of the book there is one and only one example on the CD. It is just that, an example, not a training. So, there is one 14 note ""lesson"" on intervals and from this you are supposed to magically learn how to identify all the major intervals. I don't think so. However, if you were an instructor then you could use that example as a starting point to develop your own lessons and work with students in recognizing intervals. You could spend a month on variations of that lesson itself since that's the core of ear training. In fact, if you're an instructor you can use the whole book as a blueprint for a year long curriculum from recognizing intervals to recognizing chords. 

By the way, the CD itself mostly uses really dull organ patches. The idea may have been to eliminate timbre as a distraction. However, since one of the goals of ear training is to distinguish timbre from tone, this is another example of how this book/CD in itself won't be of much use to students.

"Alright, for those of you who say Rand is criticizing works for false ideals, or lacking in substance, I say this: who is Rand to say what the absolute greatest ideals are?  Who is Rand to say what substance is?  You've got to look at her bias, first.  Realize that Rand never takes into account anything not related to personal freedom.  As if outside factors never matter; and maybe they don't, for her.  Maybe her life in an oppressive Russia did nothing to form who she is today.  But I doubt it.

Though I believe personal choice plays a huge factor in determining who we are and how we live, outside influences do affect a person.  But she doesn't.  Thus she condemns all works that are not driven solely by the individual as crap.  All books that are not driven solely by the individual's sense of reason: don't read, cause it will lessen your IQ.  

Any work that portrays or is driven by an emotion she doesn't find worthwhile or cannot understand, she condemns.

Rand, at least as portrayed in what I've read of her work, is unfeeling toward anything but what she wants.  And this is carried over into this book in what she criticizes.  They cannot hold a little or a fairly large amount of quality, they are either good or worthless.   The pieces of art she says are empty ARE empty, absolutely.  They don't fit into her paradigm thus have nothing to offer.  Nothing to offer her, that is.  

How is a completely selfish person supposed to write a critique of history's best books, telling OTHER people (with different wants and ideas and all the other funtions of an individual) What they should read?  Truthfully any criticism in this form, like a list I saw detailing the 100 best literary works in the world, is elitist crap trying to close people's minds toward books that a certain group deems lesser than others.  They have their bias like anyone else.

I say read in variety.  Observe art outside of Rand's choice of art.  Take in all you can, with an open mind, then start pondering whether you agree or not.  If you then agree because YOU agree, then I say great.  Its the basic individualistic response that Rand seems to forget to address.  She says question society, but by my line of inquiry.  She says be an individual, but only I know the basis of who you want to be

Like ""Striptease"", this book was full of typo's and appeared poorly organized and written. One would think that Ms. Shteir would have learned from her previous book--which also had similarly poor reviews. I wonder why Gypsy Rose Lee paired up with her. I can only guess at Ms. Shteir's fascination with this topic: my guess is that she wishes she could be a stripper herself (or maybe she is). I base this in part on a meeting with Ms. Shteir a year ago when I invited her to write about a professional conference I organized and presented at: she wore a very low-cut blouse as she interviewed people. I'm no prude but this was highly inappropriate and distracting people told me. On top of that, her article was chock full of misquotes, errors in fact, and adopted a perspective that nobody who attended the conference could relate to. Oh well, I can only hope that Ms. Shteir's next project will be more accurate and also that she will make clear her real interest in her subject matter.

I bought this book because I have a lot of anger in me and the preface and reviews from other well know authors sold me on it with the belief that this book would help me. But, it is having the opposite affect. I feel I was duped into buying it (because of the promises in the introduction and the glowing reviews). Part 1 tells us what a ""grievance"" is. It tells us, and tells us again, and again, and again. The thing is  I ALREADY KNOW what a grievance is! I KNOW I'm angry at someone, and I know it's not healthy, I know to forgive would help me.... I didn't need that to be explained to me over and over again for 59 pages. All that reading did was make me dwell and think MORE about the problem AND increased my anger because of the book itself. When I reached ""Part 2"", entitles ""Forgiveness"" I thought FINALLY.... but all Part 2 has done is repeat what is in part 1 and what is in the introduction - how great the study was and how much it will help me. There are some great reviews of this book here at Amazon and if this book helped some people that is great. But so far I can't agree with any of the positive comments.

In an era where girls do try out for and get placed on ""boys"" teams, these issues seem outdated.

I know, this book is from 1999, but we are living in a conservative backlash politically and this is still happening, changes are happening.  Overall I felt the book had a very negative view of the gender roles and did not do anything to suggest they should be different.  Even the disempowered girl who creates the initial problems with her ""magic"" is empowered through a pageant and her cooking.  How much more gender role enforcement can we have?  Really, with a strong female lead, shouldn't a Buffy universe story do better than this?

"This book is terribly organized.  I'm not sure what happened in writing this book, but it seems clear that Professor Jones did not compile this in the chronological order that it is printed in.

My main complaint is that rather obscure concepts/people/events are repeatedly referred to, and then only later does Jones bother to define them.  (I would almost prefer that he not define something at all, rather than offering a definition 100 pages after his first reference to it!)  The fact that the book has an index only further infuriated me - clearly the author/publisher knew where all these terms were located throughout the book, yet did not bother to offer a definition in the appropriate/first reference to the concept.

Examples are numerous, but here are a few:
**robe nobility: referenced on pages 139, 152, 183.  Defined? (pg. 183)
**sans culottes: first referenced on page 189, defined on page 231.
**Louis-Sebastien Mercier: referenced on pages 11, 138, 178, 189, 200, 204, 212, 213.  When did Jones provide information (that he was a ""journalist, dramatist and observer of Parisian mores"") on just WHO Mercier is?  Page 215.

Aside from that, there are some plain old errors.  One such is in the text box on Saint Genevieve.  Jones mentions that she negotiated with Frankish military chieftains in the 570s and 580s.  She died in 512AD, so the negotiations seem improbable.  (470s & 480s would be correct, but I should not have to figure that out.)

The redeeming quality of the book is that if DOES offer information on Paris if you are willing to sift through the above mentioned annoyances.  And Paris is not such a bad subject

"What could have been a hilarious, informative account of breaking outlandish old-fashioned laws and getting (or not getting) in trouble for them turns out to be no more than the story of a couple of clueless young British guys (I think the author is around 23) wryly making fun of America's perceived backwardness. Sometimes it just seemed like they were trying to do things and, when they couldn't, they outright gave up on some great chances. The Swedish girls in Frisco: WHY include it if it didn't come to fruition and, furthermore, involved no lawbreaking??? I'm still wondering why they included their 2-page tour of Hearst Castle when it was little more than a miniscule travel log (cool, Hearst had Greco-Roman statues in his poolroom).

They don't get arrested and they don't really accomplish anything. Too bad

"""Being a lover of freedom, when the [Nazi] revolution came, I looked to the universities to defend it, knowing that they had always boasted of their devotion to the cause of truth; but no, the universities were immediately silenced. Then I looked to the great editors of the newspapers, whose flaming editorials in days gone had proclaimed their love of freedom; but they, like the universities, were silenced in a few short weeks.... Only the Church stood squarely across the path of Hitler's campaign for suppressing the truth. I never had any special interest in the Church before, but now I feel a great affection and admiration for it because the Church alone has had the courage and persistence to stand for intellectual and moral freedom. I am forced to confess that what I once despised I now praise unreservedly.""

What I'm getting at here is that you can propogate anyone to look bad, that's easy. When you have two sources contradicting each other so heavily, you may want to consider the source; i.e a protestant british author writing over fifty years after the fact, vice a prominent and liberal jewish figure who lived through the holcaust and has no biased motive to either slander or praise the beforementioned institution.

Or maybe Israel Zolli, chief rabbi of Rome whose conversion to Catholicism immediately after the war was prompted by the church's reaction to the plight of the jewish people. 

This book is extremely propagated and heavily editorialized. It is important to read a work like this however, in order to better understand the manipulation of truth and half truth in the author's motive

"I picked this book up a couple days ago with a few others, hoping to learn about America's prison system.  I think our prison system is horrible and I was hoping that this book would give me some more information on the topic.  Unfortunately, in the first twenty pages of the book, Elsner claims that America imprisons 704 people per every 10,000 citizens.  If you do the math, that equals 7% of our population. 7% of our population is greater than the population of the State of New York.  According to this author, there are more people in prison in this country than live in the State of New York. 

Before you get too worried, let me reassure you that this is not the case.  America imprisons 736 people per *100,000* citizens (as of 5/06), or .736% of the population.  This is the highest rate in the entire world, so there's no need to move the decimal point to make it seem more dramatic. For comparison, Stalin had .771% of his citizens imprisoned in the Gulags during the height of the Purges.  Again, there's really no need to exaggerate America's rate of incarceration. What disappoints me is that this error is not simply a typo on one page, but is repeated several times.  Apparently the author actually believes we imprison 7% of our population, and the editors at Prentice Hall think that makes sense as well, as do all the luminaries who glowingly endorsed this book on the back cover. 

Personally, I can't take anything this author says seriously if there are errors so blatant a novice in the subject can them pick out, on the first twenty pages no less.  If a subject as basic as prison population is exaggerated by a power of 10, how do we know the rest of the book isn't off by a power of 10? Elsner makes prison reform advocates look like the bunch of uninformed dreamers conservatives like to imagine.  Don't buy this book

"I thought this book would be great and was really looking forward to making some of the recipes, but I have to admit I'm disappointed with the recipes and with what I've baked from it so far.  I was surprised that so many of the recipes called for vegetable shortening instead of or in addition to butter.  I know the book itself explains that shortening is used to achieve a certain texture, but I have read in other baking books that shortening is a crutch and doesn't deliver the flavor punch of pure butter.

So I was a little skeptical, and then reading through the recipes, although they are very clearly written, there aren't a lot of extra tips on technique or anything for individual recipes.  The book already assumes a level of competence.

I made three recipes from the book: the essential chewy sugar cookie, the essential chewy chocolate chip cookie, and the Fudgy Brownies.  All three recipes tasted delicious, so I can't complain there, but the brownies came out a little tough for my tastes, and both the cookies spread too much -- way too much, and I even refrigerated the dough for the sugar cookies. I consider myself to be an intermediate baker and have made these cookies from other recipes in the past with better results, so right now I'm wondering if I should even try any more of the recipes in this book or just give up.  I think it's okay for a ""base"" cookie recipe book, but you would need to look elsewhere for better techniques or to tweak the ingredients

"Dr. Hawkins first book, Power vs Force was interesting and presented a useful way to dowse using kinesiology.  However, he began to venture into misapplication of this method, and has now gone off on a tangent where he seems to wish to delude himself into thinking he has developed a fool-proof way to judge the level of consciousness of any entity, concept, or construct and the truth or falsehood of any statement.  There are serious logical, philosophical, and practical flaws in his work, and his attempt to quantify matters that aren't quantifiable leads to meaningless data that probably matches the bias & beliefs of those carrying out the muscle tests.  This book is a good example to present to show how people can deceive themselves and misuse muscle testing and dowsing techniques.  The actual technique is worthwhile, but much of what Hawkins presents in the book is utterly meaningless and invalid.  The levels of awareness that can be tapped into with dowsing are wise enough to NOT let us ask just anything we wish to and be able to receive accurate, valid answers.  
Hawkins explores issues about media, politics, religion, spirituality, history, philosophies, healing arts, entertainment, and more, and reveals his own gross ignorance on many matters.
He seems unaware that many of the people he trusts in politics and media are professional gangsters, liars, and two-faced sociopaths.  He has a negative view of conspiracy theorists, many of whom are genuinely determined to find the truth and don't resort to Hawkins' misguided shortcut attempt to identify truth.  Hawkins also fosters confusion with his description of his muscle test method, as it really has little to do with applied kinesiology, but is a form of dowsing where the muscle is directed to remain weak or strong in lieu of muscle response moving a pendulum or rod.  I hope Hawkins gets to reconsider his current efforts...consciousness and spiritual research are vital endeavors and there are others doing useful, responsible work in those areas.  For now I'd encourage Hawkins to recognize that 911 was in part an inside job, many conservative politicians and pundits are corrupt frauds, and the overall maturity of consciousness in America is not greater than the rest of the world

"Murky: 

In his book, 1984, Orwell described a contrived language he called ""newspeak"", designed to render politically incorrect ideas inexpressible. But before Orwell there were Russell and Whitehead, who contrived a symbolic logic that distorts ideas they deemed philosophically incorrect by combining logical quantification with expression of existence. As Whitehead wrote in his ""Foreword"" to Quine's Ph.D. dissertation titled A System of Logic: logic shapes metaphysical thought. 

Thus in his ""On Universals"" Quine argued that in the Russellian logic realism must be expressed by quantifying over predicates so they reference universals as ""entities"". And he co-authored with Goodman ""Steps toward a Constructive Nominalism"", a nominalist manifesto, in which all philosophers are classified as either nominalists or ""platonists"" depending on whether or not predicates are quantified so they reference entities. I believe that anyone who says that universals are ""referenced"" or who uses the phrase ""abstract entities"" fully deserves to be labeled a Platonist. 

But Loux uses the rhetoric from the Russellian nominalist newspeak. In the ""search inside this book"" screens at this Amazon web site the reader will find him reporting (p. 20) that realists say universals are shared ""entities"" and are ""referents"" of predicates. 

I ask Loux: What happened to signification? The symbolic logician Alonzo Church recognized sense (i.e. signification) as well as denotation (i.e. reference) in the functional (i.e. predicate) calculus. I ask Loux: What happened to supposition, which distinguishes reference from signification? In his book titled Meaning and Necessity Rudolf Carnap explicitly affirms that intensions (i.e. significations) may be said to be objective without invoking any hypostatization (i.e. reference), and are indifferent to either concrete or abstract objects. I ask Loux: Since the demise of logical positivism does the Russellian predicate calculus have any applications in philosophy or anywhere else? Is Loux trying to appear contemporary with the Russellian rhetoric? I see murky writing. 

Muddled: 

Loux is sympathetic to Aristotle and unsympathetic to Quine, the pragmatic realist, who rejects first philosophies with their prejudicial ontological criteria for scientific criticism, and who affirms ontological relativity in which ontological commitment is subordinated to empirical testing. 

Ontological relativity started as an analogy: Quine relativized ontology as Einstein relativized time. Einstein posited relativistic time as real time instead of Newton's absolute time, and he rejected Lorentz's making relativistic time apparent time. Likewise Heisenberg invoked this Einstein precedent for his own realistic Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory's positing of duality and indeterminacy. Today physicists describe reality in terms of superposition, nonlocality and Calabi-Yau spaces in eleven dimensions. Quine generalized beyond physics to our global web of beliefs. 

Realism is a natural, primordial, irrepressible prejudice motivated by disappointments in our beliefs including falsifications of our scientific theories. On the other hand ontology is anything but natural or primordial. It is an elaborately complex linguistic artifact that evolves and that has a cultural history. It is reality as cognitively captured by the artifactual semantics of language expressing our accepted general beliefs including our tested and currently nonfalsified scientific theories. 

But in Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic and in this book Loux rejects ontological relativity, and he calls philosophies using ontological relativity ""anti-Realism"". In fact ontological relativity and relativized semantics do not oppose realism, but rather they enable it in this age of scientific change. I do not find this book contemporary. Loux's ""Realism - anti-Realism"" locution is a false dichotomy. I see muddled thinking. 

Marginalized: 

While a student I found Notre Dame's philosophy faculty unsympathetic to contemporary pragmatism and its scientific realism. When I left their graduate school of philosophy I took with me the opinion that their academic culture is a marginalized backwater preferring to protect the past rather than forge the future with new thinking. I see in this book a textbook in Notre Dame metaphysics for Notre Dame philosophy students. 

Readers who are cognizant of the influence of modern science on philosophy - notably how quantum theory occasioned the emergence and ascendancy of contemporary pragmatism - are likely to be more critical of this book than other reviewers at this Amazon site.

"Let me get myself straigh here first. I have always been a fan of the Artemis Fowl series even though its started to fall into ruins. I loved the first one, and it was a wicked twist to the standard fairy tale stuff i ussually have to plow through, with the protangonist antoagonizing the fairies, instead of saving them from some kind of ""evil"" foe. Also the fairies were pretty cool, and had all of the problems of normal people such as sexism. They were high tech and armed with laser guns. Unfortunately the author put Artemis on the helping side of the fairies which took out some of the pizzaz.

Now let me rewiew this particular book. ITs a horrible read. who in their right mind would read something about a twelwe year old kid who investigates mysteries with no new innovative concepts?
no me. now add the fact that this mystery is completely absurd, i mean seriously a ""barbie"" doll girl who gets kids expelled from school just because they're boys. How old is the author anyways? two years old? well obviously he's not married thats for sure. I always thought that these books were aimed at 13 and 14 year olds, not four year olds. Anyways enough of that, the author also proceeds to put in someothing about a talent show and other garbage abouta possesive father. I read Colfer because he writes futuristic books, that are predominetely fantasy not preschool level books about an obssesed teen ager who doesn't even solve robberies, instead he investigates some dumb boys vs girls war.

All of the wicked humor is lost, there is no action whatsoever, the main charecter isn't a genius with wicked humor, and the book reeks of drawn of bits from the others. Heavily downgraded, adn obviously the worst parts. DO NOT EVEN READ THIS THING. get some other artemis fowl books, or read Alex Rider,. thats a very good read.

"  While it's certainly true that there will always be a gulf between reality and words, communication between reader and writer is nonetheless very real and potentially profound, thanks in no small part to empathy and the imagination. Deconstructionism, by denying presence and instead proposing unlimited differences between signs, dismisses any connection between readers and writers and turns language into a hermetic system separated from the outside world which is, of course, inhabited by people who read and people who write. This is exactly what makes deconstructionism so empty and hypocritical: It rejects traditional metaphysics while adopting a pseudo-mystical position which regards language as some unstable and solipsistic alien creature independent of everything and everyone

"Hugh Farnham is a blue-collar survivalist who likes to play Bridge.  His college-age daughter Karen, her friend Barbara, his lawyer son Duke, his alcoholic wife Grace, and house servant Joe are playing cards at his house the night the bombs hit.  Everyone scrambles to safety inside Hugh's modern bomb shelter.

As the bombs fall and his wife is passed out, Hugh starts up an affair with his daughter's friend Barbara, right in the shelter.  As if Hugh's shallowness and arrogance wasn't enough to turn you against the protagonist, this nauseating little scene will.

When the shakes and quakes finally end, the family pours from the shelter to find themselves in an impossible, pristine, clean world.  At first glance, it looks like utopia, but then as they settle into a rustic lifestyle they are suddenly set upon by an advanced race, imprisoned, and brought into a vastly different culture as slaves.  Somehow, Hugh needs to find a way to break free of the civilization they are trapped in, so that he can be free with Barbara.

Of all the Apocalypse Fiction, this book is the worst.  The protagonist is so lowbrow, so arrogant, so unlikable, so self-centered, so shallow, so immoral that he simply cannot capture any interest.  He's not even a ""love to hate"" person.

The dialogue is flatly emotionless and yet irritatingly flippant, and Barbara and Hugh's constant prattlings of ""Darling, Dear, and Beloved"" do not fit the characters.  Neither does Hugh's occasional spouting of words like ""shall"" and ""shan't"" along with racial diatribes that include heavy use of the ""N"" word.

There is little emotion from these one-dimensional characters even though they face the death of Hugh's daughter and Barbara's friend Karen, cannibalism, castration (Hugh cared more about his ""boys"" than he did his real children), pedophilia, racism, and $exual slavery, they show no more feeling than they would biting into a doughnut.

The entire plot-over-plot had a contrived and vapid feeling to it, as if the author himself didn't quite believe his story.  And if he doesn't believe, how can he expect the reader to?

Overall, there is no depth or flavor in this story at all, other than the ugly aftertaste of a musty trailer park visit in the dusty twilight, as old men drink cheap stinking whiskey and the wind blows over the city dump next door.  I recommend avoiding this book.

"No intellectual can afford to be unacquainted with the immortal John Dewey and his ""experimental school."" Who would dare criticize the education legend inseparably linked with the irreproachable rhetoric of ""progressivism?"" I would.

Dewey's conception of the child as learner assumes that the uneducated mind is essentially capable of directing its own knowledge by a spontaneous inquisitiveness stemming  from nature study. This he then expects to blossom into a more expanded consideration of the various academic subjects with the teacher merely facilitating transitions and answering the child's self-posed questions. The problems in Dewey's model begin with his science fair-meets-museum-meets-playground-meets-lecture hall school design: the model is untested on any large scale and the cost plus upkeep is prohibitively expensive. Classes are small and require several specialists and non-reusable materials. As if kids didn't have enough problems with the basic skills set already, Dewey would have them heavily involved in shop and home economics. Even more outrageous in Dewey's model is the premise that we ought never force students to study what they do not like. Their own intellectual prejudices reign supreme and by implication, teachers are discouraged from evaluating against solid standards. Experienced teachers know that kids can easily hide their shortcomings even when required to study their weak subjects, and that remediation is hard to implement before they slip further behind. How could Dewey's recommendation to cater almost exclusively to the child's intrinsic likes NOT further disguise and exacerbate low performance?

Deweyism of course, like many other off-the-wall theories of education, denies Behaviorism when it refuses to acknowledge psychological patterns in man. It depicts formulaic teaching and learning as fundamentally faulty and generalized curricula as harmful to student individuality. Nothing could less representative of the quality research conducted, particularly Project Follow Through: the great skeleton in the student-centered advocates' closet. I'd personally like to see Dewey's updated plan for seamlessly moving kids, who come into class with their ""natural inquisitiveness"" programmed by TV, rap music, and other pop media, into colonial American history, calculations of hyperbolic asymptotes, Tennessee Williams, and the ""plus-que-parfait"" tense. But of course, such leaps of interest are unnecessary if we utterly throw out the old-fashioned academic corpus along with the old-fashioned school system.

90% of students in high schools today report that they do NOT feel adequately challenged. Maybe the answer doesn't lie in yielding to children's lack of intellectual discipline but in tapping their potential to control that uninformed caprice. Dewey's ""progressivism"" relies upon the contradiction of allowing uneducated mind educate the teacher on its own education. From the absurdity of it, I can only conclude that sane people latch onto this school gedankenexperiment to maintain an escapist fantasy in light of dismally high drop-out rates, lowered standards, and social discord. But a radical solution is not necessarily synonymous with a good one

"Reviewer Alianore's opinion ""Rather too indulgent of its subject"" is a very accurate portrayal of Weir's work. I will try to add something to that near perfect review. (Note: I listened to the unabridged audiobook of ""Queen Isabella"", 22 hrs on 18 CDs).

The first half or so of this biography is mostly enjoyable, loaded with period details. The last third is the worst: Weir's fawning dedication to a glorious rehabilitation -- nay, elevation -- of Queen Isabella to the role of long-suffering, much-wronged, highly-deserving, and late-redeemed Just Queen of England.

This book is really ""subjective, rhetorical biographal dramatization"". I do not consider it to adhere to an academic standard for objective history and analysis. It is rhetoric because of the endless ""weasel words"" (and expressions) used copiously throughout: ""Some say"", ""It has been said"", ""Many believe"", ""Therefore we may assume"", ""It can be inferred"" ... this isn't just an attribute of her style ... it *is* her style comprehensively. These expressions occur many hundreds of times, commonly in conjunction with Wier's subjective analyses that present her beloved Isabella in the best possible light, always giving her every benefit of the doubt and shifting negative interpretations onto other persons.

Equally irksome is Weir's double-standard of historical psychological analysis. She is always 'declaring' for us the contents of Isabella's thoughts. Remarkable gift she has for this. Many times Weir reasonably states that modern psychological and socialogical interpretations of medieval history are inherently invalid or at least not meaningful. But then moments later she will portray Isabella's actions from a 21st century point of view ... always telling the reader how Isabella must have, might have, could have, would have been thinking and feeling about one situation after another ... often presented in a positive way that is only supported by a present-day psychosocial interpretation of 800 year old history. This isn't historical writing, it is historical op-ed, with an obvious agenda.

I don't loathe this work, it is enjoyable in many parts for its color characterizations and depth of detail. The narrator of the audio book has a wonderful voice and good pacing. But this is highly flawed in its editorial approach to historical biography. (Other egregious examples of such hagiography include Edmund Morris' ""Rise of Theodore Roosevelt"" and ""Theodore Rex"". I could not complete either of those since Morris is so obviously enthralled by his subject, lovingly lionizing him in every sappy sentence. Yuck. Really.)

If prefer more history when reading (or listening to) history. And much, much less editorial subjectivity, retroactive psychology, biased interpretation and rhetorical postulation. The only way I could enjoy ""Isabella"" by Weir is to accept her bias up front and listen accordingly, taking it with ""several pounds of salt"" as the above referenced reviewer advises.

"'Introducing Postmodernism' is a good source to gather names of philosophers, architects, artists, anthropologists, linguists, and everyone in between that have been somehow connected to PM. The problem, and it is a big one, is that this style of tour de force writing does little to contextualize all these diverse disciplines. Sure, if you only have half an hour to read up on PM, you can whip through this book and go on with your life. But if you're wanting to really absorb the phenomenon, and perhaps go on to read more, this book is NOT the place to start. Check out David Harvey's 'Condition of Postmodernism.' This will rip the top of your head clean off! It's much more weighty (in every sense of the word), but your understanding of PM will vastly improve, and will better prepare you to go on to other important writers of the 'genre'

"I truly wanted to like this book.  After years of avoidance I had just finished Moby Dick and found it not only more readable than I'd feared but downright enjoyable.  In addition I'd heard nothing but good things about this novel whose premise certainly intrigued me, and like its predecessor it has one of the truly great opening lines in literature:  ""Captain Ahab was neither my first husband nor my last.""  Alas, it was all down hill from there; overall this is one of the worst books I've ever forced myself to finish.

This came as quite a surprise because the author is no untalented hack.  Author of two other published novels and a short story collection, director of a university level creative writing program, long-term teacher of writing, and holder of a Ph.D. in same, all to considerable critical acclaim, she should be correcting and grading (failing) garbage like this not producing it.  So what went wrong?  How did this novel end up so awful?  The answer is brick by brick and piece by piece.  There is no one great thing wrong with it but rather a lot of little things.

LENGTH: If ""brevity is the soul of wit"", this novel's witlessness is easily explained.  At 666 pages (interesting number that) this novel is about three times as long as it should have been.  It would seem that, to some extent like Melville before her, Naslund confused Length with Importance, but Melville was a lot more skilled at padding than she is.  IMHO this desire to fill too many pages made many of the other problems worse by allowing Naslund both to go into unnecessary detail about things no one else cares about and to repeat herself to the point of self-parody.  Somewhere under the barnacle encrustations may be the finely lined hull of a short novel, but this was a manuscript desperately in need of editing... with a meat axe or a chainsaw.

THE NAME DROPPING: One of the pleasures of any historical novel is the encounters between fictional characters and historical figures, but if badly handled these encounters can un-suspend disbelief and downright offend.  They are badly handled here.  An almost uneducated hick from the backwoods of Kentucky encounters by chance a significant number of the thoughtful elites of mid-nineteenth century New England and those she doesn't utterly charm with her brilliance and erudition she gets the better of as in her unintentionally hilarious encounter with Naslund's peculiar imagining of Nathaniel Hawthorne.  One or two of these, developed at greater length could have added to the verisimilitude.  As it is, it is a Zelig or a Forrest Gump without the humor (or the self-awareness).

THE POLITICS: Even the most conservative readers would probably find the popular views of a majority of mid-nineteenth century New Englanders a bit disconcerting if espoused straight in a modern novel, so a certain amount of modernizing would be appropriate just to reduce the cringing.  However, Naslund takes this to the opposite extreme by having Una espouse the Politically Correct view on every single controversy of the day (and some that only exist in our significantly sillier day) from slavery to whaling, from feminism to free love, from homosexuality to sensitivity towards the differently abled, all without consequence or even criticism.  This latter is the most offputting because to have actually championed such views back then would have taken considerable courage whatever one thinks of the ideas themselves.  Una espouses them with all the negative consequences that Naslund receives for espousing them today, which is to say: none.

THE ANTI-CHRISTIAN BIGOTRY: There is nothing so very wrong with characters in a mid-nineteenth century novel exhibiting agnosticism or atheism as both views were gaining more and more credence at the time, but it is downright silly to suggest that such views would have been widely accepted.  It is even sillier to portray Christianity as something confined exclusively to the foolish, the bigoted, the future apostate, or the mentally ill.  It tells us more about the author than anything else that Una is openminded towards every religious and quasi-religious idea of the time EXCEPT Christianity.

THE FARFETCHED SCENARIOS: I sensed the novel was in trouble during the opening scene in which Una loses both her mother and her baby but manages to withstand this blow by making friends with a runaway slave with whom she has a quasi-lesbian encounter....  After this the novel goes into flashback and becomes unrealistic.  After her crazy Christian father threatens to kill her (a sentiment the reader will come to know and understand), Una is raised in a lighthouse by her ludicrously liberal-minded aunt and uncle, encounters two young men who both fall in love with her, disguises herself as a cabin boy and sails on the same whaler with them, successfully avoids detection, is sunk by a whale, survives by committing cannibalism, marries the surviving young man after he goes insane, and is abandoned by him after he goes to live with the Indians, leaving her free to ""marry"" Captain Ahab (Una never really ""marries"" anybody but of course nobody ever criticizes).  Things don't get more realistic in the second half, which includes Una's clever and successful investment in the crazy newfangled idea of obtaining oil from the ground instead of from a whale.  Riiiight.

THE MARY SUE: However, the absolute worst thing about this novel is the fact that it is a ""Mary Sue"" that peculiarity of fan fiction in which a laughably idealized and practically perfect in every way alter ego of the author fulfills some basic psychological need while inducing a combination of anger and nausea in the reader.  A more realistic main character might have saved it.  Una never learns anything from her life's too-many-to-be-believed experiences because she already knows everything.  She doesn't change because she is already perfect.  She doesn't have to deal with the criticism of others because she doesn't receive any, and she doesn't have to beg the forgiveness of those she has wronged because they forgive her so easily and besides, Una had her reasons (and they were very good ones you can be sure).

The only thing I can figure is that her publisher approved this book on concept alone WITHOUT anyone ever reading it.  I feel like I've just waded through the inept scribbling of a delusional teenage girl who insists on rereading Moby Dick in her bedroom... with the door locked.

"A singularly dull book, the characterizations seemed flat and the peg on which the novel is hung, a South victorious with modern weapons, seemed too trivial.  The author has to make something compelling in that conceit or for the reader the book will mean nothing.  Unfortunately there seems little real purpose to the idea unless one finds the characterizations of historical figures believable and they are not.  The character of Robert E. Lee in the book is just too, too good to be sympathetic or even credible and the stock characters that pop up to lend support seem like cardboard cutouts.  I finally felt that the book was going in such an obvious direction that I put it down halfway through.  I am not sure if it turns out the way I think but frankly there was nothing in the first half of the book to make me care one way or the other

It's cute and has a sort of slapstick humor that I couldn't get into.  I felt like I was reading a teen or children's book, and I don't like feeling so patronized when I read unless I knowingly pick up a picture book ready for the simplicity of a good message--even then, I don't usually feel patronized or ""written down to"".  It's simple writing and a simple plot.  It's lighthearted and thus a light read.  I imagine many people would enjoy it; I just couldn't get into it.  :o

"The literature of September 11 is never attacked.  When a book speaks of September 11 (or of terrorism in general), it is more or less guaranteed immunity from criticism; it will almost inescapably be greeted with sympathy.  Jonathan Safran Foer's EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE banks on such sympathy, on such reverence.  The narrative, which concerns a nine-year-old boy named Oskar Schell in search of a key that would unlock / unshell the enigma of his dead father (a narrative stolen, in its basic outline, from Guenther Grass's DIE BLECHTROMMEL), could have been written entirely without its scattered references to the terrorist interventions.  Nor is this trauma the only one presented in the novel: the others include Hiroshima / Nagasaki, the Staten Island Ferry crash, and the Dresden bombings.  Each disaster is generalized to the point at which what is addressed is not a traumatizing event in its specificity, but historical ""trauma"" itself and the overcoming of trauma through bereavement-inspired creation.  Oskar, the insufferable brat, attempts to complete the work of mourning for his father, Thomas Schell, Jr., a victim of September 11, by compiling an almanac of self-inflicted wounds, the collage of images and letters which is the book we are ""reading""---an almanac which, most likely, is written sometime in the indefinite future (Thomas Shell, Sr.'s manuscript of 4/12/78 is heavily edited (pp. 208-216).  Who has done the editing?  Almost certainly an older version of his grandson Oskar).  If the term, ""reading"" even applies.  Whenever a ""pregnant"" image is described, Foer literally re-presents it in the form of a pictorial image.  When a flock of birds rises into the sky, it is not enough that we read of these birds---we must see them as well.  Words may not be left in their invisibility; we are presented with supplementary photographs, illustrations, since mere verbality is not enough.  (Indeed, the entire novel oozes with misologos --- the mistrust or hatred of language --- in terms of both its content and its form.)  Photographs, yes, and also a superabundance of blank pages and nearly blank pages.  Space is not used in the manner it is in the works of Edmond Jabes, for instance.  Typography does not substitute for a well-wrought sentence.  Foer abrogates himself of all responsibilities --- most specifically, the responsibility to write well.  Why bother when the pyrotechnics of typography are at his disposal?  As far as the writing is concerned, it is composed of nothing other than mind-numbingly, soul-deadeningly repetitive phrases (""heavy boots,"" ""raison d'etre,"" etc.) and Sunday school platitudes: ""Sometimes one simply wants to disappear"" (184); ""There's nothing wrong with not understanding yourself"" (184); ""Everything that's born has to die, which means our lives are like skyscrapers"" (245); ""How can you say I love you to someone you love?...  It's always necessary"" (314).  Whenever the author writes something that he finds ""beautiful"" and ""true"" (165), he congratulates himself on his brilliance and tells us that that thing is ""beautiful"" and ""true.""  The entire book reeks of such unearned profundity.  We also learn that most dust is made up of human detritus---a very deep truth indeed, one that Foer also communicates in his essay, ""Emptiness"" (originally published in PLAYBOY) with all of the sanctimoniousness and self-righteousness of the faux naif who serves as the center of the novel, a Sunday school lecture in which we learn that famous musicians (Ringo Star) and scientists (Stephen Hawking) are unthreateningly approachable: everything is familiarized.  Perhaps it is wrong to criticize Foer for including so many blank pages in EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE, since the entire book is a vacuum: null space into which readers may project their own meanings.

"I can not stand this book. I can't even finish reading it. Kevin J Anderson can not write original Star Wars books at all. The only thing I have ever seen with his name on it that was entertaining was the Dark Lords of the Sith comic book. Everything he writes is unoriginal and lacking in story. He seems to have some obsession with Death Stars and world destroyers because all he seems to put in his books are those. Darksaber, Jedi Search, Dark Apprentice, Champions of the Force, heck even the IG-88 story he wrote for Tales of the Bounty Hunters had the Death Star tied in (IG-88 transfers himself into the Death Star...what the heck?) Seriously, this book is not worth it. Try Timothy Zahn or Michael Stackpole. At least they don't always use Death Stars. And while Zahn's last 3 books are based around Thrawn, the original Heir to the Empire, Dark Force Rising and The Last Command, when Thrawn first appeared, was not him dry humping the same concept over and over

"Native Tongue 
by Carl Hiaasen 

This book is fast paced, has a lot of energy, and a zany weirdness.  No doubt, it is a page-turner.  And it is better than the other book of Hiaasen's I have read, Double Whammy.  But all that does not a good read make...

A strength of Hiaasen's books are his characters, well defined and numerous.  Most are straightforward stereotypes, from the out-of-luck journalist-turned-publicist, the vapid sex-phone girlfriend, a steroid-doped strongman, the crude-and-sleazy millionaire bad-guy, a muscular-but-clear-minded black good-guy cop, to the dumb-but-intrinsically good-guy burglars, and loads of redneck Florida ""crackers"".  Hiaasen makes this cast interesting by having them jump through zany hoops, and by casting two characters that are quite original, an environmentally-militant 70+ aged woman, and an environmentally-crazed former-governor-gone-wildman.  And we meet psychotic whales and sex-starved dolphins.  Etc. etc.

So what's wrong.  Mainly, it's that the book stays at a level of TV-sitcom-gone-book.  It achieves zero depth in dealing with any subject.  One might think that the exception is the environment, but the story is so inane that it cannot achieve traction even here.  So perhaps Native Tongue is just pure entertainment?  If you like brainless action, gratuitous violence, gross humor, and zany ""fun"", Native Tongue might satisfy.  

I have one additional problem with Hiassen, and it's similar to the problem I so often have with Michael Crichton.  These books stink of hypocrisy.  Crichton makes a (seriously good) living off nifty science ideas while constantly bashing that same science.  Hiassen's heroes work hard to rise out of the trash heap of modern society, but Hiaasen's writing routinely wallows in that same trash heap for supposed laughs and zaniness. 

While I enjoyed a few sections of Native Tongue, I had no doubts at the end that I had wasted many hours that should have been better spent

"I am a big fan of the Missing Manual series. Previous books have given me lots of insights into my installed software and have made my computing time much more efficient. I therefore approached this book with much enthusiasm. Office is such a gargantuan program, with tons of bells and whistles, that Microsoft itself estimates that most users  take advantage of less than a third of its capabilities.

However, the book is a major disappointment, because of its many mistakes and poor organization. Most of the mistakes are ones you can work around--for example, on page 8 the topics covered by appendixes A and B are reversed--but the sheer number of such mistakes makes reading the book a major distraction. Every few pages I find myself going to the Missing Manuals web site to report yet more errata, such as incomplete or wrong instructions, figures that do not agree with the text or figure captions, incomprehensible writing, seeming confusion between the Mac and PC versions of the program, etc. And I agree wholeheartedly with a previous reviewer who complained about the inadequate index.

It looks as though O'Reilly Publishers did not do an adequate proofing of the book, but instead rushed it out as soon as possible. That is too bad, because I will now be much more hesitant to purchase another Missing Manuals title

"Oh dear. This is another book like the horrible ""Who Moved My Cheese?"" that attempts to manipulate grown adults by treating them like children.

Like the aforementioned ""Who thinks my cheese stinks?"" (or whatever it is called), I saw some people in the organisation where I work trying to sneakily weave it into the corporate culture and it lasted about five days.

It's all about making work ""FUN"". Yep, work can be ""FUN"". Tell that to the folks who work in hospital waste disposal. Or maybe those who deal with animal cruelty cases.

Of course, it's just great ""FUN"" to deal with children who have just had their parents killed, or folks who just lost their kids.

Because that's what work is - ""FUN"" - or so this book would have you believe you can convince your workers.

Of course in the examples I have listed above, it doesn't really work too well, because this is really about getting people in perceived lower-end occupations like factories or call-centres to believe their mind-numbing daily tasks can be ""FUN"".

Myself, I do have some ""FUN"" at work, but probably like many people with more than one brain cell, it is based on having a laugh with my co-workers about the sheer absurdity of where our work life often takes us.

You can call this cynicism, which is probably how it would be viewed by people who buy into this dumb ""Fish""-style ""WORK MUST BE FUN"" philosophy. I'd call it black humour, but it keeps people sane and makes difficult work more bearable.

As to the title of my review - this method of making the workplace ""FUN"" in a forced way is very useful if you have employees that you wish to isolate and marginalise.

First immerse people in the cult-like atmosphere and tell them that they are now to regard work as ""FUN"".

Second, let them know that they now ""CHOOSE"" their attitude - if they are unhappy in any way (regardless of them doing their work well or not), they are ""LETTING THE TEAM DOWN"" and not complying with the obligation to ""MAKE WORK FUN"".

Third, while the majority of victims or workers, however you choose to view your prey, swallow the ""WORK IS FUN"" message and display the behaviour of sea lions clapping to get a mouthful of FISH, you can point to those who have shown a small streak of individual identity and are not HAVING FUN AT WORK and use the Enron-style message that they ""just don't get it"".

In this way, the resistant individual can be said to be ""incompatible with our mission and values"", ""bad for morale"" or just ""out of step"".

In this way, the ""FUN-LOVING"" workers, who have now taken on the costume of ""FORCED FALSE FUN"" can be set against them.

Of course this will compound their unhappiness and isolate them further until they are totally marginalised and can be tossed on the scrapheap or forced to resign.

This book is useful then, if you wish to convince idiots that their ""WORK IS FUN"".

Just don't try it on a group of people with a brain between them who might take their work seriously.

They might tell you to stick your ""FISH"" where the sun doesn't shine

''Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of ourintelligence by means of language``

``Ambition is the death of  thought'''

These three quotes are from Ludwig Wittgenstein who redefined philosophysome70 years ago (but most people have yet to find this out).Dennett, though he has  been a philosopher for some40 years, is one them. It is also curious that both he and his prime antagonist, John Searle, studied under famous Wittgensteinians (Searle with John Austin, Dennett with Gilbert Ryle) but Searle got the point and Dennett did not. Dennett is a hard determinist(though he trys to sneak  reality in the back door), and perhaps this is due to Ryle, whose famous book 'The Concept of Mind'(1949) continues to be reprinted.  That book did a great job of exorcising the ghost but it left the machine.  Dennett enjoys  making  the mistakes Wittgenstein, Ryle(andmany others since) have exposed in detail. 

Byaccident,just before this book, I had  read ''The Minds I'', which Dennett coauthored withDouglas Hofstadter in 1981. They made some bad  mistakes(see my review), and saddest of all, they reprinted  twofamous articles that pointed the wayout of the mess---Nagel's `What is  like to be a bat?` and an early version of John  Searle's Chinese Room argument explaining why computers  don't think.

 Nagel pointed out that we do noteven know how to recognize whata concept of a bat's mind would be  like.  Searle similarly explained how we lack a way to conceptualize  thinking  and how itdiffersfrom what a computer does(eg,it can translate Chinese  without understanding it). Likewise, we lack a clear test for recognizing  what countsas good  vs bad--or just intelligible-- for many philosophical and scientific concepts. Our  use of the words consciousness, choice, freedom, intention,  particle, thinking, determines, wave,cause, happened,  event(and so on endlessly) are  rarely a source of confusion  but as soon as we leave normal life and enter philosophy(and anydiscussion detached from the environment  in  which language evolved) chaos reigns. Wittgenstein  was the first to understand why and to point out how to avoid  this. Unfortunately, he died inhis prime, his works are composed almost entirely of a series of examples of  how the mind(language)  worksand he never wroteany popular books,  so  understanding of his work is restricted to a very few. 

Searle  is one of the world's leadingphilosophers and has written  manyextremely clear  and highly regarded articles and books,some of which have pointed out the  glaring defects in Dennett'swork.His review ``Consciousness Explained  Away'' of Dennetts 1991 book`'Consciousness Explained'' and his book''The Mystery of Consciousness'' are very well  known,and show, in a way that isamazingly clear for philosophical writing,why neither Dennett(nor any of the  hundreds of philosophersandscientists who have written on this topic)havecome closetoexplaining the hard problem--ie, how do you conceptualizeconsciousness.Many suspect we will never be able to conceptualizeany of the reallyimportant things, but it isclear that we are  nowhere near it now. Dennett has mostly  ignored his critics but has favored  Searle with vituperative personal attacks.Searle has been accused by Dennett and others of  being out to destroy cognitive psychology which is quite funny as modern philosophy is(mostly) a branch of cognitive psychology and Searle has made it very clear for 30 years that WE are a good example of a biological machine that is conscious, thinks, etc,.  He just points out that we don't have any idea how this happens.   Searle characterizes as ''intellectualpathology'',the views ofDennett andall those who denythe existence of thevery phenomena they setout to explain. Dennett repeats his  mistakes here andleaves his reply to his critics to the penultimate page of  the book, where we are told that they areall mistaken and it is a waste of spaceto show how! Unsurprisingly, there isnot one reference toWittgenstein or Searle in theentire book.There arehowever, many references to other old schoolphilosophers who are as confusedas he is. 

Like most people, it does not cross his mindthatthe very inference engineshe thinks with are forcinghim to cometo  certainconclusions and that these will oftenbe quite  unconnectedwith or wrong about the way things are in the  world. They are a jumble of evolutionary curiositieswhich do various tasks in organizing behavior that were useful for survivalhundreds of thousands of years ago.Wittgenstein was a pioneerin doingthought experiments in cognitive psychologyand beganto elucidate the nature of these engines and the subtletiesof language in the 30's, and thus he made the sorts of commentsthat this review begins with. 
Dennett says(p98)that  his view is compatibilism, ie, that  free will(whichI hopewe can equate with choice) is compatible with  determinism(ie, that''there is at any instant exactly one physically  possible  future''--p25). He wants to show that determinism is not the same as inevitablity. However, the whole book is smoke  and mirrors by means of  which choice, in the sense we normally  understand it, disappears and we are  left with ``choice``,  which is something we cannot choose. Naturally, this  echoes  the fate of consiousness in his earlier book ``Consciousness  Explained``. 

It is remarkable that, at a time when we are  just beginning to  reach the point where we might be able to understand the basics of how a  single neuron works(or how an  atom works for that matter), that anyone should  think they can  make the leap to understanding the whole brain and to explain  its most complex phenomena. Please recall the last sentence of Wittgenstein  from the opening quote: ''And what'smore,this satisfies a longing for thetranscendent, because, insofar aspeoplethinkthey can see `the limits of  human understanding',theybelieve of course thatthey can see beyond  these.`` The  relation between language, thought and reality is  extraordinarily complex and everyone gets lost. If one is very, very  careful,some understanding is possible, but Dennett throws caution to  the  winds and we are dragged into the quicksand. 

There are  at least 3 different  topics here(evolution of our brain, choice  and morality) and Dennett tries  vainly to weld them together into  a coherent account of how freedom evolves  from the deterministic  crashing of atoms. There is, however, no compelling  reason to  accept that bouncing atoms (or his favorite example, the game  of  life running on a computer) are isomorphic with reality.  He knows that  quantum indeterminacy(or the uncertainty principle)  is a major obstacle to  determinism however defined(and has  been taken by many as an escape to  freedom) but dismisses  it due to the fact that such events are too rare to  bother  with. By extension, its unlikely that any such  event will happen now or even in our  whole lifetime in our  brain, so we appear to be stuck with a determined  brain(whatever  that may be). However, the universe is a big place and its been  around a long time(perhaps forever) and if even one such quantum  effect occurs  it would seem to throw the whole universe into  an indeterminate state. The  notion ''there is at any  instant exactly one physically possible future''  cannot be true  if at any instant a quantum indeterminacy can occur--in this  case  there would seem to be infinitely many possible futures. This  recalls  one of the escapes from the contradictions of physics--each  instant our  universe is branching into infinitely many universes. 

He correctly rejects the idea that quantum indeterminacy gives us the answer to how we can have choice.  This obvious idea has been suggested by many but the problem is that nobody has any idea how to specify an exact sequence of steps which starts with the equations of physics and ends up with the phenomena of consciousness(or any other emergent phenomenon).  If so, they will definitely win at least one Nobel Prize, for not only will they have explained consciousness, they will have explained the universal phenomenon of emergence(how higher order properties emerge from lower ones). So, they would have to solve the 'easy' problem(to determine the exact state of the brain corresponding to some mental state and preferably specify the exact position of all the atoms in the brain over time-ignoring uncertainty) and the 'hard' one(what exactly correlates with or produces consciousness or choice etc?). And while they are at it how about also doing the  impossible--an exact and full solution to the quantum field equations for a brain.  It is very well known that these equations are uncomputable, even for one atom or a vacuum, as it would require an infinite amount of computer time.  But infinite will do for one atom so maybe a brain will take no longer. 

He starts off on the  first page appealing to the laws of  physics for protection against fantastic  notions such as immaterial souls, but physics is made of notions just as  fantastic(uncertainty,  entanglement, wave/particle duality, Schrodinger's  dead/alivecat etc) and as Feynmann said many times ``Nobody understandsphysics!'' Many think nobody ever will. 

On pg  2 he says  our values have little to do with the goals of our cells and  on pg 2  to3 that our personality differences are due to how  our ''robotic teams are  put togther, over a lifetime of  growth and experience.`` This is a bald  dismissal of human  nature, of the abundant evidence that our differences are  to  a large extent programmed into our genes and fixed in early  childhood, and  is typical of his constant confused wandering  back and forth between  determinism and environmentalism.

On page  9 he notes that free will is a problem and our  attitudes to  it make a difference, but for whom? Nobody but philosophers. We make choices. What's the problem?  One has to step  outside life to experience a problem and then  everything becomes a problem.  What are consciousness, pain,  yellow, intention, matter, quarks, gravity  etc.? I doubt that  anyone has ever experienced a fundamental change in their  interactions  with people or their decision making processes due to their  thinking about choice. This shows that there is something  strange about such questions. Wittgenstein would probably say that the language games are  different. There are games  for language connected with the cognitive  templates for decisions  or seeing colors etc, and thinking philosophically is operating them in decoupled mode. Decoupled modes permit  thinking about the past, planning for the future, guessing  the mental states  of others, etc, but if one takes the results  in the wrong way and starts to  think `'John will try to steal  my wallet'', rather than just imagining that  John might  do it, confusion enters and those who cannot turn off the decoupled  mode or distinguish it from coupled mode,  enter the realm of pathology. Some aspects of schizophrenia and other mental illness might be  seen this way--they lose control of which mode they are in, eg, notbeing able to see the  difference between the motives people  have and the motives they might have. 

One can then see  much of the philosophizing people do as operating in  these  decoupled modes but failing to be able to keep in front of them  the  differences from the normal mode. Normal mode--eg, what  is that lion doing--  was undoubtedly the first one evolved  and decoupled modes--what did that lion  do last time or what  does he intend to do next--evolved later. This was  probably  never a problem for animals--any animal that spent too much  time  worrying about what might happen would not be very successful  contributing to  the gene pool. It is interesting to speculate that only when humans developed  culture and began degeneratinggenetically, could large numbers of people  survive with genes that  led them to spend alot of time in decoupled modes.  Hence, we  have philosophy and this book, which is mostly about running the  decision templates in decoupled mode where there are no real  consequencesexcept earning royalties for putting the results  in a book for other people to  use to run their engines in decoupled mode.' Let us alter Wittgenstein's quote to read:  ''As longas there continues to be a verb 'to decide'  that looks as if it functions in the same way as 'to  eat' and 'to  drink',as long as we continueto talk of  freedom of action, of saying I  wish I had done otherwise,  etc., etc., people will keepstumbling over the  samepuzzling  difficulties andfind themselves staring atsomethingwhich  no  explanation seems capable of clearing up.''

As withmost philosophy books, nearly every page, often every paragraph,  changes from one type of language  game to another without  noticing that now one would have to be joking or  dreaming  or acting in a play or reciting a story , etc, and not actually  intending anything nor describing an actual situation in the  world. On page  10 he says we count on free will for the  whole way of thinking about our lives,  like we count on food  and water, but who ever, outside philosophy, standing in  front  of lunch counter full of food, ever thinks how fine it is that  they  have free will so they can pick coke instead of mineral  water? Even if I  want to be a serious compatibilist and  try thinking this in decoupled mode, I  have to exit and  enter nondecoupled mode to make the actual choice. Only then  can I go back to decoupled mode to wonder what might have  happened if I had  not had the ability to make a real choice.  Wittgenstein noted how pretend  games are parasitic on real ones(this is not a trivial observation!).  The ability to engage in very complex  decoupled scenarios  is already evident in 4 year old children. So I would say  that normally, nobody counts on having choice, but rather we just choose. 


On the same page he shows again that he does not grasp cognitive  basics.  He says we learn to conduct our lives in the conceptual  atmosphere of choice,  and that `'It appears to be a stable  and ahistorical construct, as eternal  and unchanging as arithmetic,  but it is not.'' And on page 13--''It is an  evolved creation  of human activity and beliefs''. The whole thrust of  cognitive  psychology is that we do NOT learn the basics of planning, deciding,  promising, resenting, etc, but that these are built-in functions  of the  inference engines that work automatically and unconsciously  and start running  in very early childhood. There is no evidence  that they change as we grow,  or are in any way subject to  our beliefs,only  that they mature just as our body does. 

On pg 14 he suggests  its probable that our having free will depends on our believing  we have  it!  Do we believe we see an apple, feel a pain, are  happy? The language  game of belief is very different from  that of knowing. We can believe we have  a dollar in our  pocket but if we take it out and look at it we can't  meaningfully  then say that we still believe it(except as a joke etc.). The  inference engine can run in decoupled(belief) mode so we can  imagine havingchoices or making them, but in life we just make them and it is only in very  odd situations we can say  that we believe we made a choice. But Dennett is  saying thisis the universal case. If making a choice had any dependence on belief than so would everything everything else--consciousness,  seeing,  thinking,etc. If we take this seriously(and he says 'the serious problems of  free will' ) then we are getting  into trouble and if we actually try to apply  it to life, then madness is minutes away. 
. 
On page 65 et seq., he  discusses causation, intention and the `informal predicates'  that we use to  describe atoms etc, but cognitive resarch has  shown that we describe all  objects with a limited number of  ontological categories which we analyse with  our intuitive physics  modules and that when agents (ie animals or people or  things  like them--ie, ghosts or gods) are involved we use our  concepts (engines)  for agency, intuitive psychology, social minds, etc to  decide  how to behave. There is almost certainly no causation module  but  rather it will involve all of these and other inference  engines, depending on  the precise situation. Discussing  possibility and necessity is much  easier if  one talks in terms of the output of our modules for intuitive  physics,  agency, ontological categories etc. Of course there is no mention  here of Wittgenstein's many incisive comments on causation,  intention,  deciding, nor of Searle's now classic works  on Intention and Social Reality. 

He spends much time on  Ainslie's book 'Breakdown of Will', in which is  discussed  the hyperbolic discounting faculties (ie, inference engines) by which  we evaluate probable outcomes.
Hemakes much of the excellent work of Robert Frank on altruism, emotion and economics, but the book he cites was 15 years old when this book was published. It was Bingham's idea, amplified by Frank and by Boyd and Richardson (1992) that  cooperation  was greatly stimulated by the evolution of means for punishing cheaters. He suggests these as examples of Darwinian approaches  that areobligatory and promising. Indeed they are, and  in fact they are standard  parts of economic, evolutionary  and cognitive theory, but unfortunately, he  makes little reference  to the other work in these fields. All that work tends to show that people do not choose but their brains choose for them. He does not establish any convincing connection between this work and the general problem of choice. 

Onpg 216 he says that making oneself so  that one could not have  done otherwise is a key innovation in  the evolutionary ascent to free will,  and that we can only  be free if we learn how to render ourselves insensitive  to  opportunities. But where this ability resides is not revealed  for  several chapters! Dennett has a penchant for hiding  his ideas in a massive  amount of rather irrelevant text.  Again, he gets things backwards, as there is  a vast body of  very good evidence from biology and psychology that we are get  the feelings that we should behave in some way from our inference engines and  these are not provided by some part of our conscious  self, but by the automatic and unconscious operation of the  engines. As he notes, hundreds of experiments  with the Prisoner's Dilemma  and related protocols have shown how easy it is to  manipulate  people's choices and that their calculations are not conscious  and  deliberate at all. When the situation is manipulated to  make them conscious,they are much slower and  less reliable. So, there has been  constant pressure of natural  selection to make the engines fast and automatic  and inacessible  to deliberate thought.

Dennett says `we make ourselves'  so  that we could not do otherwise and that this is the basis  of morality and  choice. The evidence would seem to be exactly  the opposite. Our inference engines give  us basic moral intuitions and  we generally act in accord with the results.  If we or others  do not we feel guilt, outrage, resentment etc, then cheater genes will invade the population and this is one of the main theories as to how a good part of morality evolved.Our genes make us so we can't(mostly) do otherwise, not our will or whatever Dennett thinks can do it.   We can often choose to do otherwise but our own  intuitions and the knowledge of social disapproval  usually serve to limit our choices. These intuitions evolved  in small groups between 50,000 and some  millions of years ago. In the modern world the intuitions are often not to  our  advantage and the social controls weak. This is a prime reasonfor the chaos in the world.

On pg  225 he finally sneaks in a definition of free will  as ''a complicated snarl of mechanistic causes that look likedecision making(from certain angles)''. He claims that thisplays all the valuable  roles of free will but lacks some  (unspecified) properties possessed by  traditional free will.  The smoke is thick but I  am pretty  sure one of those unspecified properties is what we understand aschoice. He insists(top pg 226) that his naturalistic  account of decision  making leaves plenty of room for moral  responsibility, but making ourselves so  we couldn't do otherwise  does not seem to describe the way we actually  function, nor  does it seem to leave any room for morality, as that would seem  to consist precisely in being able to do otherwise. 

He  does not propose  any test for deciding if a choice is voluntary  or forced and I doubt he could  do so. Normally if someone  asks us to move our hand, we know what counts as  having a  choice, but, typical of philosophers, I expect that regardless  of  whether it moves or not he will count both as evidence for his position. 

At this point he also starts his discussion of Libet's well known work on conscious attention which is the only part of the book that I felt was worth my time. 

On page 253 et seq., he sneaks in his definition of conscious will--the  ''brains user illusion  of itself''' which has as one of its main roles  providing  ''me with the means of interfacing with myself at other times``.  And ``Illusory or not, conscious will is the persons guide  to his or her own  moral responsibility for action.`` He says  the trick we need is to see that  ``I`' control what is happening  inside the ''simplification barrier''...  ''where decision  making happens''. ``Mental events'' become conscious by  ''entering  into memory''. ''The process of self description... is  what we  are''. The crucial thing is that choice is possible  because the self is  distributed over space(the brain) and time(memories).  He realizes this is  going to leave many incredulous(everyone who can follow this and really understands!). ''I know that many  people find it hard to graspthis idea or take it seriously. It seems to them  to be a trickwith mirrors, some kind of verbal slight of hand that whisksconsciousness, and the real Self , out of the picture just when it was about to  be introduced.'' Many will say he took the words out of their mouth, but I would  say it's incoherent and  thateverythingwe know about consciousness and the whole  universe(making the obvious extensions of such claims)  was gone long beforewegot this far. 


On pg 259 he says that culture has made us rational animals!  This is a stunning denial of human nature(ie, genetics and evolution) coming from the person who wrote 'Darwin's Dangerous Idea''!  Presumably he is talking about his idea that it is memories spread over space(the brain and other people) and time that give us choices and morals and consciousness(line 6 from bottom).  He says consciousness is a user-interface but it is never made clear who or where the user is and how it interfaces with the brain(you will have to suffer through 'Consciousness Explained to find that there is no answer there either).  Though he makes many references to evolutionary and cognitive psychology, he seldom uses any of the terminology that has been current for decades(social mind, intuitive psychology, coalitional intuitions etc) and clearly is not familiar with most of the concepts. If he means that we got the fine details of morality from culture, thats ok, but this is the icing on the cake and the cake was baked by the genes.  

We are also told here that R&D(by which he means evolution here, but other things elsewhere) has given us the self  and that language creates new kind of consciousness and morality.  I am sure that he will get little agreement on this.  It seems quite clear that consciousness and the basics of morality evolved in primates(and earlier) long before spoken language(though it is a very deep topic as to how language evolved from extant capacities in the brain).  He continues ``morality memes arose by accident some tens of thousands of years ago`` which would be OK if he meant the icing on the cake but he clearly means the cake!  And then he says the point of morality is not the survival of our genes, which is an amazing (and totally incorrect)thing to say, even if he was only referring to memes.  
On pg 260 he claims  that  because we do not comprehend our ''bland dispositions  to cooperate'', they  mean nothing to us, but it is the operation  of our templates that is  everything to us. There is ample  evidence that if one of them is damaged a  person cannot function  properly as a social being(eg, autism).  I would say it is the operation of the templates for intuitive psychology etc which lead Dennett to the counterintuitive views that we do not have consciousness and choice in the way we think.  

He also says here that it was one of the major  evolutionary transitions when we were able to change our views and reflect on reasons for them. This again reflects his lack of understanding of evolutionary psychology.  I know of no evidence that the basic moral intuitions, like all the templates, are accessible to consciousness.  We may decide our cheating was justifiable, or forgive someone else's cheating, but we still know it was cheating(ie, we cannot change the engine). I suspect my ancestors a million years ago had the same feelings in the same situation but what has happened is that there are lots of other things that may be taken as relevant and that sometimes these will lead me to act contrary to my feelings.  Another issue is that as culture developed, one had to make many important or 'moral type` decisions for which the engines were not evolved to give a clear answer.  

On pg 267 he says that we now replace our `free floating rationales'(probably corresponding to what cognitive psychologists call our templates or inference engines) with reflection and mutual persuasion. And on pg 286 he says that it is a child's upbringing --demanding and giving reasons-- that affects moral reasoning. Again, he just has no grasp of what has happened in the last 30 years of research--the templates do not change with reflection or upbringing. We are then told again that consciousness makes moral issues available over time to the self, which takes responsibility.  It is not any more coherent or credible with repetition.  

On pg 289 he has a chapter summary which repeats the mistaken notions that it is culture that makes it possible to reflect and that choice depends on education(memory) and sharing.  It's clear that it is not culture but the inherited cognitive structures that make it possible to reflect and to choose and that culture determines the acceptable actions and their rewards or punishments. On pg 303 he discusses the classic philosophical barrier between 'ought'and 'is' , unaware that our templates solved that problem long ago--ie, they tell us how to feel about situations regarding other people.  He also seems to be unaware that there are hundreds of cultural universals implanted in our genes(eg see 'The Blank Slate'). 

He often starts into what looks like its going to be a good discussion of some issue in evolutionary psychology, but invariably wanders off into philosophical arcana and winds up with more confusion.  This happens on pg 261 where he states that concepts like 'praiseworthy' were shaped over millennia by culture, while most would say the basis for such concepts is in the genes and each culture only detetermines the details of acceptable reactions to the intuitions its members get from their innate mechanisms.   On pg 262 he tries to explain how an ESS(Evolutionarily Stable Strategy) can produce morality. His idea here is that genetic `R&D` produces dim understandings of morals and then culture(memetics) produces variations and clarifications.  I would say that we all know, and much research has made clear, that we commonly get very clear results from our inference engines and only dimly understand in special cases.  Culture merely decides what we can do about our feelings.  

The last part of the book is mostly  concerned  with moral culpability. He refers to the legal classic by Hart  and  Honore, which I started reading 30 years ago since it's  authors were deeply influenced by Wittgenstein.  Dennett tells us that we have  control over our own morality and  that thinking about morality will improve us.  But, there seems  no justification whatever for this view in this book. There is nothing at  all  here to help anyone escape from the dictates of the monkey mind. It is a defensible point of view that those who manage this do so by traveling a spiritual path that  has no connection with philosophy- and there is not a hint of  spirituality in this entire book--another telling point considering that many mystics have fascinating things to say about the functioning of the mind. I find  more wisdom about how  to be free and moral in any of Osho's 200 books than anywhere in philosophy. One rarely finds spiritually and morally  advanced people teaching at universities. There is no sign here, nor in  anything he has done, that Dennett is morally superior. After 40 years of thinking about morality he launches personal attacks on his critics or arrogantly dismisses them.  It seems clear that, like all of us, he is trapped in the limits of his inference engines. 

So, how much opportunity is there to  improve our morality? It seems  clear(eg, see Pinker's `The Blank Slate`) that  most of our behaviour  is genetic and the rest due to unknown factors in our  environment, in spite of the vigorous efforts of parents and religions and political parties. On  average, maybe 5% of the variation in moral behavior(variations are the only thing we can  study) is due to our own efforts. The moral choices that matter  most today are  those affecting the fate of the world. But our moral templates were not evolved to deal with overpopulation and the greenhouse effect. 

How remarkable it would be if just one of the hundreds of millions of educated people in the world managed to figure out what consiousness or choice or any mental phenomenon really is.  And if one did, we would expect them to be a scientist at the cutting edge of research using some exotic fMRI  equipment and the latest parallel processing neural networked fuzzy logic computer etc.  But a philosopher or physicist just sitting there thinking, coming up with the solution to the greatest puzzle there is!  And then writing a whole book about it without checking with the sceptics first.  To return to the quote at the beginning--'Ambition is the death of thought'.  Indeed--though clearly Wittgenstein was thinking of interesting thoughts

"I have enjoyed many of Mark's novels (Do You Know That I Love You is my favorite of the bunch), all the time recognizing his severe limitations as a writer.  

Every character in every Roeder novel speaks with the same voice--all of them, and though his dialog is usually age appropriate for his teen characters, his narrative passages invariably sound as if they were written by someone decades older.  There is frequent repetition and redudancy; characters never say anything once if they can say it two or three or four times (though he has definitely improved since his mediocre first novel Ancient Prejudice, which had the unfortunate distinction of glamorizing teen suicide).  His characters always (and I mean always) mate for life, which is a beautiful romantic ideal, but ultimately can get tiresome (gay teens are no different from straight ones in their need to play the field a bit before a lifetime commitment).  

All that said, at his best (DYKWIK, A Better Life, Keeper of Secrets) Mark Roeder writes a compelling and often un-put-downable story.  

But in Outfield Menace, the bad most definitely outweighs the good.  Did Mr. Roeder do ANY research into the time period???  The fifties are certainly a good setting for a gay teen novel (if only as an educational experience for contemporary teens, who don't realize how impossible it was to be gay at that time), but if you want to set a novel in the fifties, don't have a lead male character with a ponytail.  No one, but no one, wore a pony tail in the fifties (and certainly not in a small midwest town).  Don't have characters use anachronisms like ""fifteen minutes of fame.""  And most of all, don't have characters behave and think in anachronistic wasys.

Mark Roeder illustrates the dangers of self publishing.  He has apparently made a name for himself (and some money I'd guess), and I must confess, I've bought his novels (glutton for coming out stories that I am) but no legitimate house would publish his novels, at least not without major editing and rewriting, something that a self published author (especially one with an apparently inflated self image) goes without.  

There has been a renaissance in quality gay teen fiction this past year or two.  Major publishers have put out such superb young adult novels as Totally Joe, M or F?, The Hookup Artist, Rainbow Road, Boy Girl Boy.  Read them, if only to see how these truly outstanding (and published by legit houses) novels could teach Mark Roeder a thing or two.  

If you must read Roeder, then stick with his better novels and avoid this serious misstep.  Memo to Roeder: if you want to write about a time you don't know about, do your research

The problem with ""Why the Clintons Belong in Prison"" is when the author (cut and paste expert) attempts his own narrative, which is sporadic, jumpy and poorly edited.

"The joke here is that Krugman is convinced he can write.  He ends his little intro with the smug assertion that ""maybe economists can write after all,"" offering himself as proof.

"I have an Amazon bookmark that advertises Ludlum's book ""The Sigma Protocol"". It says ""In Ludlum's latest, an ordinary man battles a global conspiracy."" Well gee. That's the plot of THIS book as well. Come to think of it, that's the plot of every book by the man that I've read. A 'vast right wing conspiracy' is set to take over the world. They have small armies, a lot of money and a plan. This time around, a group of military men (naturally) plan to foment terror, and use the chaos to implement their vision of the world (laugh not - millions in the Middle East and far Left believe 9-11 was something along the same lines). Enter ""ordinary man"" Joel Converse. He's a Vietnam vet and P.O,W. who thought he had left that life far behind. It's up to him to save the world. He will survive certain death several times (the bad guys always seem to think they need him alive, and they just HAVE to explain their conspiracy to this total stranger). He will find love, and he'll visit several European cities to boot. Of course, a suspension of disbelief is essential for many novels (how else would you believe that a Nazi and an Israeli are on the same side?), but Ludlum's cliched stories are further worsened by the fact that he just couldn't write. His dialogue writing is always tedious, and sometimes just painful to read. Action scenes are generic. The only thing he could do right is character background, but that's not enough to save this.

"Many reviewers compared this novel to Jurassic Park, saying it was a better book than Crichton's. What absurdity. I am not saying that JP is an awesome book, but it was far better than Tyrannosaur Canyon.

Tyrannosaur Canyon is a fairly intriguing story, but poorly executed and VERY poorly ended. It's as though Preston suddenly realized that he was going to have to get his characters out of the predicament he had put them in, and didn't know how to do it. The ending is too fast, too unlikely and too unrealistic.

The book closes with a theistic comment by one of the characters, which I believe is Preston's way of attempting to belong to both camps, having his science AND being religious.

Overall, I had high hopes for this book and I am sorry to say that in the last 100 pages, I was greatly let down
